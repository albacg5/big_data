"OEBPS and OCF are two generations of an open-standard format for eBooks, both
built upon HTML, XML and ZIP.

This format is used internally by proprietary eBook tools such as Microsoft

open-standard eBook readers such as OpenBerg Lector or dotReader/ThoutReader.
There is also a possibility that this format will be used by One Laptop Per
Child to provide eTextBooks for Third-World Children.

Unfortunately, to this day, there are no open-source tools able to produce
OEBPS/OCF eBooks. Which is, most definitely, a shame. I therefore suggest the
inclusion of OEBPS/OCF import and export filters to OpenOffice. 

The export filter should be able to
* convert a document to either one or several XHTML files (split by, say,
chapter or section, etc. depending on the user's wishes), with their
dependencies (images, style sheets, etc.)
* create a metadata XML-based 'package file' containing informations about the
book title, author, subject... as well as the reading order of the split XHTML
files, as per the OCF file format
* for compliance with OCF, add the ODF metadata information
* zip it all.

Conversely, the import filter should be able to open that same format.

"Actually, I would like to ask for 2 enhancement regarding the appearance of
header and footer in the writer application:

a) visually dimm (watermark-like) header / footer
-------------------------------------------------
Dimm the appearance of header and footer while in the document (body) editing
mode (in comparison to the print preview and print mode), by giving them a
softer appearance, like a watermark.
-> This way one can easily edit the body section of a document without being
distracted by header and footer, which are often very similar to the body text
(and are mostly the same for all the pages). Still one does clearly see how the
document looks like with header/footer.


b) protect header and footer against accidental editing
-------------------------------------------------------
Using a double click rather a single click to enter editing mode for existing
header / footer.
This helps user to avoid accidentally modifying header / footer.
(I know, there are work arounds, so one could protect it by an additional step.
But let's make it easier not more difficult.)


I often use templates for different documents and it would make life much easier.

While I find plenty areas of OOo superior to MS Office, I find the above 2 areas
 more convenient solved in MSO (in editing the document body and editing
existing headers / footers).

That was with version 2.0 under Linux. Then with 2.2 under Windows XP, exactly
the same symptoms. Also with the latest 2.3 snapshot under XP.

I tried turning off show changes but it didn't help.

I tried making somewhat different changes, in either of the 2 paragraphs on that

seem to be reproducible.

When I opened the original unedited document and continued with my editing from
the paragraphs in question, it worked fine.

I've tried to simplify and also obfuscate the document, but it's hard to find
things to do that don't make the bug disappear. Deleting all the images (using

removing certain text, but other similar changes made the bug go away.

After the formula has been inserted, the *text* cursor should be given back,

The current behaviour requires a rather unintuitive ESC key press before the

For anyone writing a document with a lot of formulae and symbols, this small

A further unituitive thing is that after pressing ALT+I, O, F, the UP and DOWN

'DOWN' does not return the formula to its original place. And pressing 'DOWN' a
second time moves the formula *up* again. Pressing 'LEFT' and 'RIGHT' don't do

"The navigator has a box for entering a page number into.  The way the box works
makes it surprisingly hard to jump to a particular page number, especially on
longer documents.

If you clear the contents of this field, it will repopulate itself after a short
delay.  If you do not type fast, it is impossible to, for example, back space
over '50' and type '35' instead.  I witnessed a user end up several times with
3550 as the page number to go to.  I can't see why this field shouldn't stay
blank if you backspace over it.

(This is compounded by the fact that the contents are not selected automatically
when this field is selected.  [seemed to be the case on both Windows and Linux.]
 If contents were selected, you could simply type your new page number in,
without having to erase the first one.)

Here's another problem.  Probably meant as a feature, when you put a new number
in that field, it automatically jumps your document to that page.  But suppose
I'm on page 135, and start backspacing.  If I pause while typing, I will end up
on page 13, or page 1.  There is then no obvious way to get back to where I was
on 135.

If some or all of this is seen as 'feature' rather than bug, then it would be
nice to have an option to disable it (perhaps labeled 'make navigator page

"When scrolling a document with multiple pages, the document scrolls up appropriately for each scroll 
event. This can be problematic because I do a scroll up, causing say 10 scroll up events and each one is 
captured and performed. But, because all are captured and performed and because of the slow 
processing of a scroll event (maybe just my machine or platform of Mac OSX 10.4.10 G4 1GB RAM) the 
time taken to scroll up a little bit is a few seconds and passes what I wanted to see in most cases. Many 
times I find myself watching what I wanted to scroll to pass by the screen as I wait for the scrolling 
events to stop being processed. I have to be very careful not to scroll too much.

NOTE: The current scrolling behavior might function just fine for existing platforms and it could be that 
it is the mac platform that generates scroll events differently and causing this issue. I remember talking 
to the NeoOffice people about scroll events and their system was at first multiplying scroll events which 
led to eradic behavior on slow machines. So, they corrected it but it leads me to believe this behavior is 
a platform issue and was solved by NeoOffice somehow so could be done here too.

What might be a simple solution to this is to capture the scroll events but if there is a bundle of them in 
the queue, don't scroll each one separately but maybe do them all at once (might be too large a jump) 
or in groups of several at a time. This would clear the queue of the events faster and probably be closer 
to what the user wishes to experience. The entire system would appear much more responsive and 
interactive. Additionally, a faster system would be able to pop these off the queue faster anyway so it 
wouldn't backup and need to skip events. Hmm, maybe a better strategy would be even to look at the 
time of events so it would process a certain time period of scroll events and not a certain number of 
events on the queue.

Here are some scenarios: 
1) I want to scroll up maybe half a page. So, I scroll up just a bit. After maybe a half second pause the 
scrolling starts and I see what I want so I stop.
Now: The screen keeps scrolling for another half second worth of scroll events. When it finally stops, I 
have to scroll down again because I overshot what I wanted by a page or half a page.
Future: Scrolling stops when user scrolling stops. Because the events were pulled from the queue en 
masse, as opposed to one at a time, the queue was cleared faster and the screen stops when the user 
wants because nothing else is on the queue.

2) I want to scroll way up the document so I do one long scroll. 
Now: The document starts to scroll up for each scroll event and I am forced to wait for each redraw of 
the document as it scrolls up 17 pages, one inch at a time. This takes several seconds.
Future: The up scroll events are captured in a group and the user is shown the document 17 screens up 
from the start of the scroll.

NOTE: It might be somewhat disorienting this way so a ramp-up and ramp-down of scroll events might 
be the desired feel of scrolling.","ENHANCEMENT"

http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?t=61935&highlight=

the problem is with bullets following a numbered list. whenever there are nested
bullets within a numbered list, the bullets encounter problems, specifically:

1. first bullet after a number will not change it's bullet type automatically
when pressing <tab> 
2. the second bullet will attach itself to the first one, when it is moved one
level to the left of the previous bullet.

how to replicate:
1. insert number (<F12>)
2. type text, press <enter>
3. press <tab> to move one level to the right; type text and press <enter>
4. press <shift><F12> to change number into bullet - notice here that when
moving the bullet into different levels (<tab> or <shift><tab>), the bullet type
doesn't change it's appearance

5. type text and press <enter> to insert another bulleted line on the same level
- this time, the bullet type will change when moving the bullet to levels going
to the right
6. bring second bulleted line one level to the left of the first bullet
(<shift><tab>) - it should change bullet type
7. now press <tab> - see that the above bullet (bullet 1) will also move along
with bullet 2... whichever way you go (to the right or to the left)

in our discussion, i am told that i am going against the nature of how OOo
handles lists. such that a numbered list should IDEALLY not be on the same level
as a bulleted list, supposedly causing the irregularities. 

the problem with this type of handling is that it is assumed that users will
only have numbered lists on any given level. but what if say, the numbered list
has ended, and users want to add bulleted lists on level 1, indicating that it
is not a sublevel or part of the last numbered entry, but a bulleted entry in
its own right.

a workaround given is to format your bullets and numbered list in such a way
that they do not reside on the same level, which i think makes sense for better
formatting and layout, but sacrifices flexibility and user control over lists.
in addition to this, the problem of the bullets attaching themselves to each
other would still be present, regardless of level. the problem is with bullets
coming after numbered lists, not their level.

i'm not sure whether this would be considered a bug, or users not having the
right idea how bullets and numbers should be placed, formatted or handled in
documents - but who determines what? isn't it the users and not the application?

please check the link to the thread which also includes screenshots with
discussions, plus a sample document.

file-types give us this error--only XML files.  We can create Text Documents,
Spreadsheets, Presentations, Drawings, Databases, etc. and successfully send
e-mails using the same method.  This issue only is seen when using XML Form
Documents.

Here is the full text of the error. 'An error occured in sending the message.
Possible errors could be a missing user account or a defective setup.  Please

Here are the steps to recreate the issue:

"Try this:

* In a fresh document with the default settings, insert a special character from
a font other than the default font. (On Windows, where the default is Times New
Roman, you would for example insert a character from the Symbol font).

* After that special character, type some more normal characters (which will be
in the default font, which is correct).

* Modify the font for the paragraph style of the paragraph you are in (Standard
in a German Writer with a fresh document and default settings).

* You will see that the characters that you typed after the special character do
not show the change in the font.

Writer behaves as if inserting the special character had applied a manual font
setting directly after the special character, overriding the font setting from
the paragraph style.

Maybe this was done on purpose, maybe it was an unintentional change. It is not
that big a problem since one can still revert to the paragraph font setting by
Ctrl-Shift-Space directly after inserting the special character.","DEFECT"

Why not making the format->page dialog only relative to the page (i.e. the size of the page, its 
background, its border for the whole page, the presence or not of a header/footer, the global printer 
margins...) ?

And then make the text zone the main frame, the header also a frame, the footer also a frame... For 
each frame, it will be possible to set the border, the background... These frames would be editable as 
frame styles.

I think it would be the most logic thing! Because for the moment we have in the same dialog options

This is very confusing for the user, since the reverse of 'inserting' a page

that the delete action at the end of a paragraph could check if the next

"INTRO
=====
After analysing for almost 9 month (January - October 2007) the use of various
Office applications (both OOo and competitor products), both at home (personal
use), in a business environment (auditing dozens of employees), and in various
other academic environments, I noted some common patterns of page sizes:

[for US-users: please consider letter-size whenever you encounter A4 during the
following paragraphs]

I.) NUMBER OF PAGE-SIZES

a.) most users (>80-90%) will use for most of the time (>80-90%)
    a single page size
b.) most users (>95%-99%) will use at most 2 different page sizes
c.) almost all users will never use more than 3 different page sizes

I acknowledge, that here will be some very specific situations where some users
will need more than 3 pages. But these situations will affect a very limited
number of businesses.

II.) PAGE-SIZES PROPER

a.) the most used page size in Europe is A4 (letter in the US)
b.) I rarely encountered the use of A3 (mostly spreadsheets)
c.) I rarely encountered the use of envelope-size


THE PROBLEM
===========
When selecting a page size, the user has to choose from a big list of page-sizes
one will *NEVER* use. Most users will need *only* 2 or 3 page-sizes during their
whole lifetime.


SOLUTION
========

a.) split the page-sizes list in 2 parts
b.) first part contains the 3 most frequently used page sizes
c.) the 2nd part contains all page-sizes
d.) allow user to define his 3 most frequently used page-sizes
    [in my business would be A4, A3 and envelope]

This would allow most users (>99%) to easily and very fast select most of the
time (>99%) the proper page size with *minimal effort*, without impeding more
special users (<1%) to select different page-sizes.","ENHANCEMENT"

DISCUSSION:

The reason copy & paste of text/html from Java to e.g. OpenOffice Writer doesn't
work (tested with different JDK 1.4.2, 1.5 and 1.6 and Windows 2000, similar
problem was reported also for Windows XP as issue 51267) seems to be that Java
sets the StartHTML and EndHTML properties of the Windows HTML clipboard format
to -1.  

See http://www.peterbuettner.de/develop/javasnippets/clipHtml/index.html

If I use the Clipview app on that page and manually modify the StartHTML and
EndHTML properties of the text/html copied from Java, I am able to paste it into

"Dear Members!

If you have a heavy or light hand, capitalisation tends to get wrong.

Emacs and other decent editors have keyboard shortcuts to fix this.

Browsing the file tree of an OOo 2.1.x installation dumped me into the
'Capitalise' macro both in BeanShell and Python code.

In OOo 2.1.x the elaborate auto-word-select code refused to work, you had to
double-click to get it fully selected beforehand.

This has been fixed in OOo 2.2.x.

It is no problem to assign this to a key combination.

Here my suggestions:

A good key combination (I'll use Emacsese for these) is S-f3.

This one did exactly the same as your 'Capitalise' macro back in DOS-Word 4.0
and 5.0. I had also DOS-Word 5.5, but this was superseded too soon with WinWord
2.0a.

In the Writer, fortunately you can assign this to OOo globally. This global
option is not available in the other components.

To popularise this, I suggest to configure the keyboard this way by default,
and, not unimportant, advertise it in the help and the tips, albeit practically
 everybody switches off the tips. If he can search it in the help, much less
traffic will be generated from newbies.

"Dear Members!

There is in the CSS specs an option for print layout named 'page-break-before:
avoid'

This was introduced due to the fact that the web designer is unable to
anticipate the paper format the user may print upon. Also the display size
options of MSIE will propagate through to the printer, messing up page breaks
even more than other browsers.

The only program that implemented this feature independently from the W3C was
AMI Pro, bought once by Lotus, so it came to me during the OS/2 period. Later
Lotus renamed it Word Pro and retained this feature.

Most people will be unable to appreciate this feature.

Well, I started with punched cards about 30 years ago, so I have still the habit
of letting the machine do the work instead of doing everything manually the PC
hast taught generations of users.

The problem:

Most of the documents that went on paper were plain business letters, which have
several formal header parts, a number of paragraphs in the body, and several
formal trailer parts, at least the 'Kind regards' or similar above the
signature, bureaucratic formalism may call for a couple of trailer parts more.

Perhaps I am that idiosyncratic, but even with the typewriter, I managed to get
my letters exactly that long, that the 'Kind regards' had to be queezed in the
bottom margin.

On the computer, this got orphaned on the final page.

Aye, DOS-Word 4.0, 5.0, 5.5, and Winword 2.0a allowed me to switch between
different print layout templates twiddling with margins.

Also they allowed the 'Standard' paragraph format to be cloned and a
'page-break-after: avoid' added.

As pointed out above, this is a nuisance to me.

A 'page-break-before: avoid' can be put into the document template, thus the
need for a manual afterwork is eliminated, and even paper and ink saved when
this formatting error has made it onto paper which is quite likely especially
under time pressure and other stuff in a busy office.

Thus 'page-break-before:avoid' became to me the killer feature of Lotus Word
Pro. I hope they haven't patented this.

OOo lacks the 'page-break-before: avoid' because it started out as an MS-Office
clone.

MS-Office, however, never implemented it, despite my complaints at the
registration of DOS-Word 4.0.

Instead, having seen lots of versions on various business computers, their
Usability Lab is toddlerising the users increasingly with every version,
breaking the habits of experienced users with every new version, eliminating
functions from main and right-click menus, moving them to little known mouse
gestures, you can't even use the keyboard shortcut available in Explorer's
details view.

So the feature suggested here will appreciate concerning users, as should be
more numerous with OOo than with any other software, with the exception of Word
Perfect and LaTeX/TeX, their users had the option to put a 'page-break: avoid'
/between/ paragraphs, which could go into their document templates.

To advertise this feature, the letter document templates should have
preformatted their trailer components with 'page-break-before: avoid' and this
should be advertised in the help and tips as well.

Increasing numbers of OOo users getting used to this way of automation will have
fun letting MS-Office users in the dust, that may generate quite a number of
flame wars in the appropriate forums.

"Issue 83491 complains about massive performance regressions even though the CWS that introduced it 
made text layout only a little bit more costly.

Analyzing the situation showed that the whole textbox is reformatted from top to bottom for every 
single replaced codepoint! This causes quite some sluggishness. It would be better to convert whole 
paragraphs or even the whole document at once and reformat then.

Here is the backtrace of the performance problem, which may be helpful to find the culprit of the 
excessive reformats:

"Nested tables seem to disappear after saving as ODT in certain situations.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE PROBLEM
(I'm doing this in OOo 2.3.0 on a Windows XP machine)
1. Create a new Writer document
2. Format page, and make it landscape, with 3 columns
3. On the first column, create a table with 1 column + 3 rows.
4. Adjust row heights so that the table fills the entire column (e.g. with A4
paper 21cm high and 2cm margins, set row heights to 5, 7, 5), and uncheck 'Fit
to size'.
5. Make the first row align-to-top, second align-center, and third align-bottom.
6. Add some text to the first row, and create an empty standard 2x2 table
underneath.
7. Add some text to the second row, and create an empty standard 2x2 table
underneath.
8. Add some text to the third row, and create an empty standard 2x2 table
underneath.
9. Save the document in the normal OOo's ODT format.
10. Close Writer, and reload the file - Observe that the third nested table
(added in (8.)) disappears.

NOTE: Playing around with nested tables in this kind of scenario seems to break
Writer quite easily, sometimes I also have the 2nd table (added in (7))
disappear instead, or it even hung once when I did a save, though I haven't
found a way to consistently reproduce these.","DEFECT"

What happens is that whenever spellchecker moves to a NEW set, then I can't undo

words in THAT SAME set.
So let's say the word I want to undo is in currently in that same SET that
spellchecker is going through at THAT specific moment, then undoing to previous
word will work. But let's say that suddenly I click Ignore/Chance/Whatever, and
the spellchecker moves on to a net SET of sentences, and I want to undo to the
PREVIOUS set of sentences, because the word I want to undo was in the previous

image can appear as a 'watermark' if the image is mostly transparent. When text

image, they produce visible rendering artifacts in an exported PDF.

Steps to reproduce:

Workarounds:
* Instead of a transparent background image, use an opaque image. In an 
  image-editor, create a white background layer under the transparent image,
  then 'flatten' and export to an opaque image to be used as the Writer background.

"Currently, fields that a user places in a document (to be filled in later by a

inserted in a field that is either longer or shorter than the static field 
length, the information is either truncated (in the printout), or white space 
is left at the end of the field.  This results in unprofessional documents and 
prevents the use of fields for creating forms that can be filled in later by 
other users (especially if the document is locked to prevent the user from 
changing important aspects of the document, such a contract language).

The fields should expand and contract dynamically, and even wrap around to the 
next line if the input is long enough.  This would allow, for example, the 
legal department to create a contract form with blanks for price, date, and 
name and address of contracting party, that a salesperson could fill in later.  
If the document is locked (and preferably the lock is password protected), the 
salesperson could not change any of the legal language, but could still 
generate a contract that looked professional.

"Trying to set up templates for a large group. People aren't necessarily local

fields to hold values for variables like Client_Name, Software_Release etc. I 
also insert an instructional text string such as 'Change Title in File > 
Properties' which points them towards the DocInfo field Title. I use these 
fields/variables to populate the headers and footers and boilerplate text. 

When the user creates a new document based on my Word templates, all the user-
defined fields exist along with their default values. In OOo, the users must 
KNOW about the fields and recreate them themselves. Only the DocInfo field 
TITLE even still exists. All the other user-defined fields vanish entirely.

"In a listbox which is being used in a dialog you can select entries by clicking

view there is one really important feature missing to offer easy usable end user

this functionality.
In my current project this missing feature leads to the necessity of inserting a

entry he can't remove this selection anymore by just clicking on it. If the user
decides to not select anything in the current listbox he has to know that this

"Heading 1 is linked with Heading.
Heading is set to Lucidux Sans.  
If I set Heading to Times,

This is as it should be.

However, if I set Heading 1 to times, I

say, reset it 'follow the linked style'.

I thought that either reset

standard should do this, but on this particular build/platform
it seems to have no 
effect.

Desired behaviour:
For each selector in the style editor I would like:
An 
indicator of what the linked style is:
An option to inherit.

The indicator could vary: On 
list items such as font family, weight and
style, the link style could show up as white on red 
instead of white on 
blue.  Where the local style inherits, it would be shown as white on 
purple
(combination of blue and red)  Ok, angry fruit salad.

The linked style would be shown 
in oblique, while the set style would be 
on dark blue.  Where local style inherits, it would be in 
oblique bold on
dark blue.

On things that affect the ruler, show two sets of tokens on the 
ruler line,
one in two different colors, or one set above the ruler, one set below.
This would 
include margins, firstline indent, tabs.

For checkbox items, it would show a second set of 
checkboxes that were unchangeable, but one checkbox would be 'inherit' meaning that feature

"Occasionally, when copying text which contains small superscript numbers to the

"Hello.

When using the Mail Merge Wizard, at section '3. Insert address block', I select

address block'.

I match the fields that I am using to ones that are allowed: e.g. We do not have

the fields that I do not use in the address block, such as DOB and Phone Number.

The wizard will not let me proceed until I have matched everything.

This is very frustrating for two reasons:

   1. I am not using these other fields, why on Earth should it care ?

   2. There is no message to state why I cannot proceed, it just will not let me.

Would it be possible in the short term to have an-on-screen notification saying
'Not all fields matched' or something similar.

In the longer term, can it please allow me to ignore fields that I am not using ?

"In most high-end page layout programs, including Pagemaker, InDesign,
QuarkXpress, and also in Word Perfect 6.x and later, justified text is handled
far more intelligently than it is in OpenOffice, and Microsoft Word (at least as
it is set by default).

Currently in OpenOffice.org, when text is justified, the line breaks appear to
be made as follows:

If the current word will not fit, try to hyphenate it (assuming hyphenation is
turned on). Otherwise, move it to the next line, and increase the spacing
between words on the current line to fill out the line.

The result is that justified text looks uneven from line to line. Microsoft
Word, by default, justifies text in this same way.

A better way to handle justification (known as Full Justification in Word) is as
follows:

Assign a minimum word-spacing value, relative to point size. When justifying a
given line of text, check first to see if the current word spacing can be
condensed, to fit the given word on the current line. If it can, do so, if not,
hyphenate or move the word to the next line and expand word spacing on the
current line.

This behavior can be duplicated in Microsoft Word by doing the following: Tools,
Options, Compatibility, Do Full Justification Like WordPerfect 6.x for Windows.

The result is much more professional looking layout. Also, page space is used
more effiently.

(Note: When you turn on Full Justification in Word, the onscreen results look
poor, as the WYSWYGI engine only condenses the later part of the line onscreen.
However, it looks great when printed.)","ENHANCEMENT"

"I am writing to report a bug that we have experienced within our firm of 200 
users.  This is in both OpenOffice 2.0.2 and OpenOffice 2.3 - I expect it is 
probably a problem in all the versions.

We have created a datasource (an odb file) that points to a csv file.  We have 
some templates (ott files) that have fields inserted from the datasource.

Our users press F4 to launch the datasource window.  Select the option to merge 
data to fields, check that the document looks correct and then print it.  When 
they print the document a message appears asking if the user wants to print a 
form letter.  If the user clicks No, then the document prints fine, they can 
close the document and the csv file can be edited again.  This is all fine and 
expected.

The problem is if the user does the above and clicks Yes.  The document prints, 
the document is then closed by the user but the csv file remains locked by 
OpenOffice.  The csv file cannot be edited.  Closing OpenOffice and the 
Quickstarter usually releases the lock on the csv file and then it can be 
edited.  On occasion, a full restart of the PC is required to release this lock.

This is a problem for us as we use the csv file as part of a merge process for 
creating many of our documents. Also, our secretaries can have several 
documents open, and it is time consuming to have to close and re-open 
OpenOffice.

"When a table contains vertically merged cells, those cells may break across
pages at the subordinate row boundaries even when the table properties are set
to disallow breaking of rows. In my case, the intent of the vertical merge was
to create a single complex row grouping several closely related rows, and not
allow the group to break across pages. This is how Writer functioned in version
2.0.4 and probably all releases prior to 2.3. It appears that changes made for
other issues have made it impossible to specify this behavior. 

The best workaround I have so far discovered is to split the table at the first
of the rows comprising a group that would be broken, inserting a manual page
break if necessary. This introduces a great deal of sensitivity to changes in
column widths, page margins, and even cell contents for *any* of the cells
preceding the artificial split if that changes row heights.

Either the interpretation of disallowing row breaks should be extended to
disallow cell breaks, or a new option is needed to specifically disallow cell
breaks, or some kind of 'keep together' formatting capability is needed (e.g.,
Ctrl-{ to mark the beginning and Ctrl-} to mark the end of material that should
not break across pages; this could be useful even outside the context of tables).","ENHANCEMENT"

"Preamble:
- yes, I know the HTML export is currently stalled...! But maybe, while
implementing new notes, we can improve the filter a little bit in this area?
- This issue deals whith 2 different problems. Ask if you need 2 tasks :)

1) Notes creation time, date and author get lost when saved to HTML (FEATURE).
Writer 'Notes' are exported as neutral comments (<!-- ... --> HTML tag) to HTML.
Everything which is not part of the note body (time, date and author) is not
exported to HTML.
-> it may be quite easy to export this information 'as' note body whith special
keywords and parse this keywords when importing.

Example: A note is inserted by author Max on 29th, January 2008 at 23:00 with
body 'I am a note'
The comment code could be:
<!-- %note_body='I am a note', %note_author='Max', %note_time='20080129;23000000'-->

2) The first note of an HTML document is destroyed when the document is edited
by someone else as the author (BUG).
Description:
- New HTML document
- Tools - Options - OpenOffice.org - User Data
- Type First name: 'Creator', Ok
- Insert a note and type 'This is a note' in it
- Save the document
- Tools - Options - OpenOffice.org - User Data
- Type First name: 'Review', Ok
- Type something in the document
- Save the document

1) allow setting every needed parameter from the Tools -> Chapters numbering

If I set up outline levels in a master document, for example level 1 - heading

1.1.1 sub2b

will become
1.1 Main
1.1. sub1

I can fix this by setting the outline levels in the sub document - however there
is increadibly slow as outline save as does not save the heading style only the
outline formating and loading the styles also does not set the outline level

"In Writer, the user can chose where he wants to check the spelling. Besides the
normal text, it is possible to extend the spellchecking to 'special regions'

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new document and enter some text including some words with spelling
mistakes.
2. Insert a header and add some (wrong) text here, too.
3. Activate 'check spelling as you type'. The words with spelling mistakes
should be underlined in red.
4. Activate 'check special regions' in 'Tools - Options - Language Settings -
Writing Settings: Options'.
5. Run a normal spellcheck with 'Tools - Spellcheck...'. Writer will check the
content of the whole document, even the text in the header.
6. Deactivate 'check special regions' in 'Tools - Options - Language Settings -
Writing Settings: Options'.
7. Run a normal spellcheck with 'Tools - Spellcheck...'.

Expected result: Writer will check the words in the main text area, the header
(the special region) will not be considered.

Current result: Writer behaves like in step 5 and checks the content of the
whole document.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
If the option 'check special regions' belongs to 'check spelling as you type'
too, then the red markups should disappear in Step 6. But even in this case
nothing changes.

OOo help on 'check special regions': Specifies that special regions, such as
text in headers and footers, document tables, and text frames, are checked
during spellcheck.

User mod briefly looked at the code and told me that the algorithm has only
influence on the 'check spelling as you type' in draw objects (are draw objects
related to tables and headers?). Additionally, the result inside the code is
always 'false' independent from the checkbox state. So there is no effect at all.

"after reading : http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Font-FAQ
to figure out where the issue lyes, this is what i think is happening...
 
when using a non-hebrew font (that has no hebrew glyphs) the wordart
font-substitution engine does not change to some pre-defined hebrew supported
font so it could display the glyphs like Writer's normal text engine does.

using the 'Font Replacement Table' with 'my defined font substitutions' it works
fine :-) BUT... i can not guess all the fonts out there ;-)

here are two samples;

using font 'Andale Mono', some bizarre glyphs are located in the font table
position where hebrew glyphs should be and this is the result:

"I already opened a similar case, it was closed as unresolvable, I reopened it 
with a detailed explanation of a simple solution of the problem but did not get 
an answer or comment. I must note that there was a lack on my side because I 
didn't mention the role of widow/orphan control im my original description. 
That's why I want to resubmit the case with a new description and a slightly 
altered test file. At the same time I will close the old case. Independent of 
this lack on my side I think it was obvious that an editor should not work in 
the described situation as Writer does in the moment.

1) Open the test file. You see a full page so that any new line will add a new 
page. The page has a big footnote area. 
2) Locate the line 'INSERT A CHARACTER HERE (POINT1):' and enter a character 
after the colon. You see that the design of the page is preserved because the 
inserted character is shifted to a new line on the same page and the remainder 
of the page remains unmodified - except the end of the footnote area what is 
shifted to the new page. But this does not destroy the design of the page. This 
is a desired behaviour what Writer also show in the next case but does not do 
that.
3) Delete the inserted character and insert a character after 'INSERT A 
CHARACTER HERE (POINT2):' It is a paragraph with active widow/orphan control as 
all other paragraphs have this option activated. The new thing with this 
paragraph is that this paragraph has a big footnote. This seems to let Writer 
think that it should shift this paragraph to a new page. The consequence is 
that the complete big footnote is shifted to the next page too so that more 
than a half of the original page is blank now and the design of the page is 
destroyed. But it is absolutely not necessary to do that. The previous case 
shows that it is possible that a new line can be added on the same page and 
that only the end of the footnote can be shifted to the next page. This would 
preserve the design of the page and this should be the way how Writer should 
work in this situation.

Of course you can say: Disable widow/orphan control. But then I have a single 
line or worse, a single word at the start of my next page. To avoid that I need 
widow/orphan control. Why it should not work in this situation without the 
destruction of the design of the previous page?

"I would like to start a discussion regarding the implementation of the 
Bibliography database function. I am willing to take on a role in formulating 
requirements for this if it is required. 
 
I am David Wilson. I have had some 20 years professional IT experience, which 
included database and application design, but I am a terrible programmer. 
Currently I am writing a MA thesis in history and I use OpenOffice (641) on 
Linux. 
 
This is my first posting here so please forgive if have missed some of the 
previous discussion, and please let me know if I am on the wrong track here. 
 
The Current Facilities 
 
In the current version (641) we have the old StarOffice 5.2 Bibliographic 
database and its simple reference insertion process. When an OpenOffice 
bibliographic entry is dragged onto a document, a dialog box opens which 
allows one to select the fields we want for the entry. This is saved so next 
time we can just drag the field entry into the text. For example ?Oisin and 
Patrick? in Irish Myths and Legends, Lady Gregory. (London: Running Press, 
1989) 412-421. This fine for a book entry but if I next need an Journal 
article entry I have to adjust the field list to look like ? T.M. 
Charles-Edwards, Honour and status in Some Irish and Welsh Prose Tales. in 
Eriu, xxxvi 1978.? Then I may need to insert an article in book, then a paper 
from conference proceedings, ect. It does not support the character 
formating, I have to adjust this myself. This was just not practicable. 
 
We also have the new ?Insert>Indexes and Tables>Bibliographic Entry?. This 
does will not select entries from the current bibliographic database on my 
system. But I assume that this will be fixed in a later version. It does 
allow me to add Bibliographic entries for the document, add references into 
the text and to produced a Bibliography. The format of the Bibliography can 
be finely controlled (it has character formating) and this is a very good 
piece of design and implementation. 
 
The Issue 
 
But these is one major problem with this. It seems to support only one of the 
commonly used citation methods ? ? the parenthetical or author date-method, 
and does not support the other common method - the footnote or endnote 
method. We I add a ?Insert>Indexes and Tables>Bibliographic Entry? it asks me 
to select the short name (the Citation Identifier) and it pasts this as a 
field into the document - (WILSON2002). 
 
Proposal 
 
I propose that we support the footnote or endnote method as well. This 
 defined in the ?Chicago Manual of Style? (Documentation is on the web at 
http://www.fsu.edu/~library/guides/chicago.html .). 
 
A suggestion is that the ?Bibliographic Entry? Dialog box allow the selection 
between the two methods, this would select for the insertion of the ?Short 
name? or for the formated text string similar to that defined for the 
Bibilography entries. This would not be too difficult to do. Ideally support 
could also be developed for the style convention that the first mention of a 
reference contain the full detail as and all subsequent references use the 
shorter version - ?Oisin and Patrick? in Irish Myths and Legends, 412-421. 
(without the publication details.) 
 
 
Even better would be to select the style conventions predefined and to be 
 able to select the style required - such as Chicago, APS, Harvard, ect. It 
 might be consided that the Style Convention attribute should be applied to 
 the document as a whole, to avoid mixtures of styles, and examiners red 
 marks. Also selection of a document style could also set other document 
 defaults, such as spacing, heading format etc. This would greatly facilitate 
 the accurate setting up of the document format ( I have not looked far into 
 this aspect). 
 
As facility of importing Style Conventions would be required. Endnote 
 provides style definitions to the general public which could be imported if 
 their import format was decoded. 
 http://www.endnote.com/support/enstylesfinder.asp 
 
We will have reached nirvana when, we can write one paper and just by 
selecting the required document Style Convention, print off submissions to 
numerous journals (all with different strictly enforced style conventions). 
Also we will have just about replaced Endnotes (TM), which will save many 
thousands of poor university students hundreds of dollars, euros etc. 
 
I welcome any comments or suggestions.

"When OO0 2.3.1 imports a Word 2003 document with multi-level (outline) automatic numbering, OOo moves the period to before the number instead of after it, and ignores indents.  

In MS Word 2003, each outline level was somewhat modified from default by adding the standard period after the digit instead of a parenthesis mark.  Each level was linked to one of Word's built-in heading styles.  The Word documents were created with customized templates, not normal.dot, but in testing and replicating this bug, normal.dot also exhibited the same behavior.  Interestingly, Microsoft's 'Remove Hidden Data' utility eliminates the problem.  

Here are two files that show the problem. Both are MS Word 2003 files.  Open each first with Word and then with Writer.

http://virtuality.dreamhosters.com/Autonumbers2.doc was made from the problem file by first changing the template to normal.dot and then saving as to a different name. This file still has the different appearance in Word and Writer 2.3.1.

"I have Split my Bibliographic Database enhancement proposals into 4 seperate proposals.   
My full proposal and links to relevant wweb based information is at   
http://www.users.bigpond.com/dnwilson/biblio1.html   
   
Proposal 1.   
  
I propose that we support the footnote or endnote method as well as the current Author-date    
in-text method eg(DNWilson2002). As one example this defined in the ?Chicago Manual of Style? (Documentation   
 is on the web at http://www.fsu.edu/~library/guides/chicago.html .).    
    
I suggest that we modify the ?Bibliographic Entry? Dialog box to allow the definition of the citation    
 reference. I suggest adding a new button ?Define Citation?. This would bring up a dialog box with     
a selection button ?Different First and Subsequent citation formats?. This dialog box would have    
 two tabs ?Citation Format? and ?Subsequent Citations? (this second tab would only be active if     
?Different First and Subsequent citation formats = True?. The tab dialogs would be identical to     
the ?Insert>Indexes and Tables>Type =Bibilography>Entries Tab? dialog box and its code. It would     
just store its output under a different field name.    
    
For the Author-Date method, the user could set ?Different First and Subsequent citation formats = False?,    
 and set up Brackets and short name field eg (WILSON2002.  
For the footnote / endnote citation method the user could define the appropriate reference Inital string eg     
 
?Oisin and Patrick? in Irish Myths and Legends, Lady Gregory. (London: Running Press, 1989) 412-421.     
 
Then set up up Subsequent shorter string eg.    
 
?Oisin and Patrick? in Irish Myths and Legends, 412-421.     
 
or just    
    
?Oisin and Patrick?, 412-421.

My full proposal and links to relevant wweb based information is at       
http://www.users.bigpond.com/dnwilson/biblio1.html       
     
Proposal 4   
   
Add Support for Document Style to be added to Document Properties - as an New Tab Box to    
Files>Properties>Styles. Also Use a Predefined Styles List to Set Bibliographic Citation    
and Bibliography Formats and Other Document Styles and Settings.    
   
I suggest adding Support for Document Styles To be applied to the whole document. It could    
be an new tab box called  Files>Properties>Tab Styles. This would allow the user to select    
from a predefined list of Document Styles. (We need to do a user survey to find a candidate   
 list to support, I have little idea what Europeans use). The tab box would also have a    
?Re-apply Style defaults? button to over-write used changes to settings. The List could    
include document styles as ASP, APA, MLA, Chicago,  etc.    
   
The election of a document style would load Bibliographic citation and Bibliography formats.    
Also other document styles and settings could be set as well. I have not researched this in    
any detail.) The Chicago style for example recommends double spaced text-body, Indented single   
 spaced quotation style, Single spaced lists tables and bibliography. This does not seem hard    
to implement as the selection of the document styles would just reset lists of    
default document settings.    
   
An Import Styles function could also be added. These importable styles could be developed separately  
 from the main OpenOffice release and easily added by the users. Endnote does this and them make them   
available to the general public at http://www.endnote.com/support/enstylesfinder.asp .   
If we could unscamble the Endnote format (it is not plain text - it may be compressed)  we your convert some the  
information directly.","ENHANCEMENT"

The footnote mark (asterisk) is too small compared to what I see in Word, and
what I expect based on the typographical convention (see attached screen shot).

Possible Explanation:
The numbered footnotes are marked with a number with superscript character style
(named “Footnote anchor”), as it is expected. If I select asterisk as a footnote
numbering, the asterisk from “Times New Roman” font is _already in superscript_.
When OpenOffice.org Writer puts it in superscript, it appears in “double
superscript”, thus extremely small and extremely upper position from the baseline.

Suggested solution:
Hard-code some Unicode characters which are already superscripted (e.g.: the
asterisk, those Unicode characters which contain the “SUPERSCRIPT” tag in the
description, eg. “º” and “ª”), and exclude them from the superscript style, when
applying the “Footnote Anchor” character style.

different margins, which change every few lines -- so consistant margins is a MUST in using a 
different word processor).

However, there is a significant problem with the pagination.  
Both files (RTF and MS Word -- as saved by Word Perfect) created a new page every time I changed the 
margins.

Is there any way to import files like this by keeping the margins intact AND keeping 
the original pagination (or close to it)?

Thanks!","ENHANCEMENT"

"In Writer's unusual formula expression language, functions do not require
parentheses around their argument list. It is acceptable to write
  =sum 10|20
giving the result: 30.

However, if the user writes
  =sum 10|20 * 2
the likely expectation, based on experience with other expression languages, is
the result 60. I.e. the function call with its argument list is evaluated before
the arithmetic operator. This is not the case. Writer evaluates this expression
as sum(10|20*2) = 50.

To avoid this, the user must be experienced enough to debug the problem and add
the necessary parentheses:
=sum(10|20) * 2
or
=(sum 10|20)*2

This is made more difficult because the function list in the formula bar
supplies only the function name, with no parentheses, and they are not required
for correct syntax, so there is no hint that they may be needed in a case like this.

Perhaps the precedence of function calls could be raised to give the more usual
and expected order of evaluation.

Alternatively, perhaps the function dropdown could insert a set of parentheses,
as a hint that they can be used and may be necessary.

"I am using Odfpy 0.7 from http://opendocumentfellowship.com/projects/odfpy to
build an .odt to be later edited using OpenOffice.

I found that a created style which inherits another style is not properly
rendered in OpenOffice 2.3.0. More specifically, the inheritance is ignored. If
I create an automatic style though, the inheritance is respected and the result
shows combined styles properly.

I've created a sample application to generate a document which triggers this
behaviour:

-- START --
#!/usr/bin/env python

from odf.opendocument import OpenDocumentText
from odf.style import Style, TextProperties, ParagraphProperties
from odf.text import P

textdoc = OpenDocumentText()

style_base = Style(name='MyStyle', family='paragraph')
style_base.addElement(ParagraphProperties(textalign='center'))
textdoc.styles.addElement(style_base)

style_new = Style(name='MyStyleDerived', parentstylename=style_base,
family='paragraph')
style_new.addElement(TextProperties(fontweight='bold'))
textdoc.styles.addElement(style_new)

txt=P(stylename=style_new, text='My Text')
textdoc.text.addElement(txt)

textdoc.save('sample-styles.odt')

-- END --

If I change this line:
> textdoc.styles.addElement(style_new)
to:
> textdoc.automaticstyles.addElement(style_new)
the generated document is rendered correctly.

The expected rendering would be the text 'My Text' centered and bold.

Please note that KWord 1.6.3 renders this correctly.


---

Also, a document in which I manually change the parent style using the Organizer
tab > Linked with dropdown is properly rendered any time it is opened. I do not
know what OpenOffice saves besides the style which makes it behave properly
later. The XML style definition generated with Odfpy is the same with the one 
OpenOffice generates, but I do not know what else OpenOffice uses which triggers
the correct rendering.","DEFECT"

"** This is my first issue I've tried hard to follow the process correctly -
including looking for similar issues. Apologies for any mistakes. **

The ability of OO Writer to use named cross references is one of its great
advantages over MS Word.

However, if an inserted cross reference points to a reference that does not
exist (usually because the text surrounding reference source has been deleted),
then the cross reference displays as a blank space.

When dealing with a large document with many named cross-references, if one of
the inserted references is subsequently deleted, then it can be extremely
difficult to locate referring cross references without extremely close and
error-prone proof reading.

A logical solution would seem to be to replace missing cross references with a
message such as 'reference to missing reference: xxx'.  This would allow errors
to be detected much more easily at the proof reading stage.  

MS Word does something similar with missing bookmarks. The difference is that
Word tends to drop them without warning...

I am going to attempt to attach a short sample document with cross-references to
two named references: ref-tree and ref-fruit.    The former (ref-trees) is
present in the document, and the cross reference displays correctly.  The latter
(ref-fruit) has been deleted and the cross reference shows as a blank space.","ENHANCEMENT"

"Hi there,

I am currently using OpenOffice 2.2 on a PC with Linux/Ubuntu and
discovered the following problem with an alphabetical index:

After creating an alphabetical index for a (odt- or odm-)document and
inserting index entries into the doc the index does not appear in
alphabetical order. Also the identical alphabetical delimiters appear
several times in different places (still in front of the corresponding
entries) across the index.

I was not able to solve this problem, but found a way to work around it:
I discovered, that in the menu â€œInsert Index/Table / Optionsâ€? I had not
ticked the box 'combine identical entries'. This must have caused the
entries to get messed up, since the entries affected were words I had
marked as both 1st keys and simple entries (of other 1st keys). With the
box ticked the index looks intact.
Thus, by right-clicking on the index and going to 'EDIT INDEX', then unticking
or ticking the BOX â€œCOMBINE IDENTICAL ENTRIES' you can literally switch the
problem on and off.

I first encountered this problem when working with a master document
covering a large number of subdocuments, but found it can be reproduced
with only one file, which I will attach to this e-mail.

Thanks for reading this and taking care of it.

"I you write texts that contain a lot of formulas, it would be helpful to have

This would allow to modify all formulas in a text file in the same time.

For example, imagine you have written a text with a 12pt size with a lot of
formulas, also in 12pt fonts. Then, you want to modify your text in 10pt. It can
easily be made by changing the size of the font in the default style. But your

We could find similar examples if you want to modify spacings, or alignment, or

"HOW I UNDERSTAND OPENOFFICE WORKS:
Line numbers are kind of binary thing.  You either (1) have them off for the
whole document or (2) on for the whole document.  You can specify what the
counting scheme (count by 5, count by 1, restart counting at each page break,
etc.) is for the whole document and only for the whole document.  You may
opt-out of the line numbers for each style, but you may not change the counting
scheme for that style.  


PROBLEM:
I need some sections of the document to have no line numbers, some to count by
5, and some to count by 1.  I need some sections to restart the line number
counting at the top of each page, and other sections to start recounting at the
beginning of the section.

So, an example document may include the following sections, with the following
settings:
header/footer (pages 1-7), has no line numbers;
section #1 (page 1), has no line numbers;
section #2 (pages 2-4), has line numbers that count by 5 and restart counting at
the top of every page;
sections #3, 5, 7, 9, & 11(all on page 5), have no line numbers;
sections #4, 6, 8, 10, & 12 (also all on page 5), have line numbers, which count
by 1 and restart at the beginning of each section;
section #13 (page 6), has line numbers that count by 5 and restart counting at
the top of every page;
section #14 (page 7), has no line numbers.

When MS Word documents, setup with the above line numbering, import into
OpenOffice, OpenOffice takes the 1st section with line numbers, enables that
sections line numbering scheme as the default behaviour for the entire document.
 In later sections, any subsequent line numbering properties are ignored.

So, an example document that OpenOffice produces includes the following
sections, with the following settings:
header/footer (pages 1-7), has line numbers that count by 5 and never restart
counting (which means the header on page 3 has a ?5? next to it);
sections #1-14 (pages 1-7), has line numbers that count by 5 and restart
counting at the top of every page.

I have a ZIP file with a DOC, PDF (for the DOC) and SXW of an example of the
line numbering that I want and what OpenOffice does with it.  Once, this is
assigned, I can email it to the issue?s owner.


REQUESTED ENCHANTMENT:
Increase the granularity of the line numbering schemes.  Allow me to fully
change the line numbering scheme for each section/style/paragraph and the
header/footer.

While, for a MS Word person, it would be most intuitive to have line numbering
schemes follow the section boundaries, it might be easiest to leverage off the
existing ?opt-out by style? setup.  I think having a full blown line numbering
capability associated with the style would be as intuitive as associating the
line numbers with the sections. 

For what I do the lack of line number flexibility is kind of a show stopper. 
However, I am very impressed with everything.

</HEAD>

This has been reported many times since the early days of OO and was repeatedly
closed with no solution.

If I have an option to make writer NOT mess with <HEAD> that will help me to do
my job as I will be able to control the style externally. At this moment I just
want writer to generate text and default html tags with tidy as it does now, to
be controlled by the external css.

It will be an option in Tools-Writer/Web such as:

'Preserve non-<body> content' or 'Keep <head> as loaded'

"When I use the arrow keys to scroll down in a word processing document, the 
text suddenly scrolls several lines, just like in Emacs. I hate it. It is so 
confusing to have to focus again and find out where the text jumped to.

I think that when scrolling using the arrow keys, the scrolling should be only 
one line at a time, like in the following programs in Windows: Notepad, 
Wordpad, Word, TextPad.

Maybe some would like the Emacs scrolling, and some won't (like me). So it 
could be made a user setting. And obvious place for the setting in the user 
interface would be in Tools | Options | Text Document | View | View, just 
below 'Smooth scroll'. I guess it could be a number 'How many lines to scroll' 
which could be set from 1 (my preference) to whatever the user wants. Right now 
the setting is at about 8 or 10, I think, and not changeable.

I don't mind what the initial setting is, as long as I get to change it to 1.","ENHANCEMENT"

"I open a .doc document. It has an image (animated) inside the text.
When you scroll down the display (the text +image goes up), at a particular
line, always the same, the image continues to go up if you stop the scrolling or
faster than the text if you continue scrolling, then looks like touching the top
and comes down to the right place, then goes up again, in an endless process,
like a yoyo.
If you scroll one more line, then the text below the image follows the image
upwards, line by line. when the image comes down the phenomenom restarts.
If you go down to the bottom, the display is OK, but when you scroll up towards
the top, the image is still going up and down with the text attached below.
It looks like that it is the line of text which is in regard of the 'lift' which
is  pulled by the image below it.
The phenomenom occurs if you scoll with the lift or with the up and down keys.

"Sometimes, I need to copy the formatting of a paragraph or list to a different
paragraph or list.

Of course, styles would be ideal, but it just happens that most documents do not
use styles. IF you are not the creator of the document, you can't take even the
blame for not using a style.

Also, some formatting just evolves over time, so when the need for a style
emerges, it is already too late. The user is now struck with applying all
attributes to the different paragraph or list, or create a new style from
scratch. Both options are rather poor.

I propose a different mechanism:

SOLUTION
========

1.) When the 'Nonprinting Characters'-option is selected,
    Writer will display a 'P' at the end of every paragraph.

2.) The user should be able to select this 'P' and drag-and-drop it
    over another paragraph / list

3.) that paragraph / list should receive the settings of the previous
    paragraph.

4.) dragging-and-dropping the 'P' over the 'Styles and Formatting'-window
    should create a new style (either paragraph or list, depending on
    context); this new style should take the attributes of the
    selected paragraph / list","ENHANCEMENT"

"[Issue data has been moved from issue #85870 to cover the more general aspects
of the visibility of the Notes Side Pane.]

The following problem has been found in the build â€œedgy-jdk-2474-notes2â€?.

Current behavior: If there are no Notes in the document, then changing the
setting â€œView â€“ Notesâ€? will not show the Note Side Pane nor any Notes. This does
not correspond to a fundamental law of interaction design: providing feedback on
actions. So this may lead to usability issues with that functionality.

Proposed behavior (Please note that this issue does NOT fully describe the
desired behavior. It is intended to give you some ideas how this could be
implemented. Please refer to the specifications in the Notes2 wiki for more
information or contact me directly.):
If a document is opened which contains Notes, then both Notes Side Pane and
Notes are shown (Notes â€“ View is activated)
If a document is opened which does not contain Note(s), then the Notes Side Pane
is not shown (Notes â€“ View is deactivated)
If no Note(s) are contained in the document, the Notes Side Pane is not shown
and the user activates Notes â€“ View, then the Notes Side Pane will be shown.
If a Note is inserted and the Note Side Pane is not shown, then both Note
Windows and Note Side Pane will be shown (Notes â€“ View is activated).
If the Note Side Pane is shown and all Notes are deleted (deleted: no Note
present in the document), then the Note Side Pane will stay open. (Notes â€“ View
will remain active) (Currently, the Note Side Pane is closed automatically if no
Note is present in the document.)

The proposed behavior tries to first address the needs of the user (e.g. when
opening the document) and will then try not to be too 'smart'.

Please note: It may be very useful, if the visibility of the Notes and the Note
Side Pane could be controlled in a more direct manner. This may include a
control element in the horizontal ruler bar (please refer to the specification
in the Notes2 wiki), an entry for the Note Side Pane context menu or a context
menu entry for the Writer background â€œWieseâ€?. Please contact me when you start
to work on that proposals.","DEFECT"

After several minutes of frustration and menu exploring she might try to turn

I suggest that you consider locking apect ratio per default and put a 'Allow

"Summary:

Writer is not able to open documents that contain a text:h child-node inside a
draw:text-box node. 

Detailed Description:

According to the ODT 1.0 schema definition a draw:text-box node may contain
text-content which also includes text:h nodes.

If a document contains such a text:h, a non-explicatory error message is shown
('Error reading file.') when trying to open the document and the document is not
opened. In versions prior to OOo 2.4.0 document recovery is started (which fails
to recover the document).

This error is reproducible on several machines and different platforms (Win** +
Linux) and in different versions of OOo (2.4.0 and earlier).

KWord (1.6.3) and Lotus Symphony are able to open such documents as well as the
OpenXML/ODF Translator Add-in for Word, thus it would be an improvement to
interoperability if OOo also could handle such documents. 

At least, OOo could treat the text:h as a text:p node in the context of a
text-box node.","DEFECT"

"This issue applies across all OOo apps, wherever there is a font selection menu.

The Font menu in the Toolbar (and also in the context popup) oversimplifies the
list of available fonts, where a variety of typefaces exist.  Furthermore, the
font preview shown in the toolbar menu seems to be selected at random from the
available typefaces for that font, and does not match the typeface of the
characters inserted into the document.

For example, in Writer activate the Font toolbar and scroll down until you get
to 'Helvetica Neue'.  The example text is actually rendered in the font
'Helvetica Neue Light', but if you select the menu entry Helvetica Neue, and
type some text, it will appear in 'normal' weight Helvetica Neue.

If you right-click on this text, and select 'Character...' from the popup, and
then look at the Font tab, you will see there is one font Helvetica Neue and 13
different 'typefaces' listed.  

If you select the text, and right click to get the context popup, the Style
submenu does not list Light as an option.

So there is no convenient way to type text in (e.g.) Helvetica Neue Light.  You
must type the text and then go through the Formatting window.

For comparison, Word 2008 lists Helvetica Neue and four other variations as
Fonts (Helvetica Neue Black Condensed, Helvetica Neue Bold Condensed, Helvetica
Neue Light, and Helvetica Neue UltraLight).  Each of these has four options for
'font style' of Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic.

"This bug is similar to 61075 but was not resolved when 61075 was resolved in
002.4 : 

Bibus is a free, open bibliographic database program
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/bibus-biblio/) that can interact both with MS
Word and OO. The interaction with both programmes works slightly differently. 
The problem is that when references and bibliographies are inserted into a .doc
document using Word and Bibus and then this .doc file is opened using OO2.4, the
fields have disappeared, they are not even imported as simple text. This is a
regression as at least the simple text-importation has worked in older versions
of OO (see 61075 for this). 
I have attached a .doc file that has been created with Word 2003 and Bibus. When
opened using OO2.4, one can see that neither the inserted citations nor the
bibliography is shown (i have also tried this with word 2000 with the same
result). The result (not showing the fields even as text) is the same if OO is
run on a computer where MSWord is installed or if OO runs on a computer where
MSWord has never been installed. I mention this as somebody else had commented
for bug 61075 that this was the case.

Thanks in advance for having a look at this. Bibus is a really good
bibliographic software and more and more widely used, but one of the few
handicaps it has is that one cannot switch between Word and OO without loosing
the bibliographic information. It would be a good sign if one of the biggest
open software projects existing makes an effort to help other, smaller open
software projects that have less resources.

first '-' stays fat and bold, like it was set there by me.

Remedy: alter auto-bulleting so as to it continues till 'return' occurs a second
time; then, when text is entered in the third line, the empty line in-between
gets cleared of the bullet, if another 'return' is received, all empty prior
bullets are being deleted and auto-bulleting shuts off. Also, please make sure
the wizard is exchanging the very first of the '-' placed by the user with a

"This issue is an outcome of issue 90130 ('After text' spacing not added when

When wrapping around an object as shown in the examples, 'Before text' is added
against the right edge of the object whilst 'After text' space is not added
against the left edge of the object. This is inconsistent.

IMO it would be more intuitive to add the Before/After text spacing at all times
since I believe that is the users intent when specifying those options.
Introducing special contexts where that does not apply only distracts the user.
Any object wrap spacing should be added to the text spacing, giving the user
more flexibility in formating documents if they choose whilst making their job
easier at the same time. That is, IMO, issue 90130 should be reopened and this
issue closed.","DEFECT"
"Pasting a figure into a frame works if the frame is in the middle of the page. 
But if the frame happens to fall at the top of the single text column on a page,
then pasting the figure into the frame instead somehow plasters the figure onto
every page of the document rather than into just that one frame.

How to demonstrate:

First demonstrate how the paste operation is expected to work.  Open two
documents at the same time:  one, a Writer document containing multiple pages,
and the other, a Draw document.  Make some simple figure in the Draw document,
with various boxes and arrows.  Now back in the Writer document, go to the
second page in the document, and after some initial text on that second page,
create a new frame, one that lies somewhere in the middle of the page.  Make it
6'x0.2', with autosized height, as you create it.  Once it's on the page, click
elsewhere in the page to deselect it.  Go back to the Draw document, type Ctrl-A
to select everything in your simple figure, then Ctrl-C to copy it.  Go back to
the Writer document and click the text cursor in the frame you just created. 
Now type Ctrl-V to paste the figure there.  The figure will end up in the middle
of that page, as you would expect.

Now to demonstrate the failure, follow the same procedure, but this time, put
enough text on the page and select the position of the new frame within that
text such that the frame cannot fit on that page and instead ends up at the top
of the following page.  Now go through the same copy/paste procedure.  What you
will find is that the figure ends up not just on the page where you pasted it,
but on every other page of the document!

It is nearly impossible to figure out a workaround, as there is no obvious clue
as to why the failed paste does not work as expected.  Only a lot of stumbling
around and experimenting finally yields an understanding of the boundaries of
the bug.  That makes it very difficult for most users to accept Writer as a
workable product, if figure inclusion is a common part of their documents.","DEFECT"

"Hi,

I'd like to use parentheses, for footnote anchors (in the text area), for better
separation.

For example: Foobar(1), with Â«(1)Â» in superscript.


However, although we can add characters, before and after the number, in the
footnote area (in the footnote settings, the Â«BeforeÂ»/Â«AfterÂ» fields -the fact
it applies only to the footnote area, is not clear enough, by the way), we
cannot add characters to the footnote anchor (in the main content).


It is good to keep the two locations independent, regarding prefixes/suffixes.

For example, in my case, in the footnote area, I use: 1. Lorem ipsum.


There should then be a new set of Â«BeforeÂ»/Â«AfterÂ» fields, in the footnote
settings, to set a prefix/suffix, for footnote anchors.


A more global solution (I didn't search for an existing report, but I guess it
exists), would be to permit to defined prefixes/suffixes, for any element, like
in CSS (the Â«:beforeÂ» and Â«:afterÂ» selectors, with the Â«contentÂ» property).

manually, which is not too problematic, for footnotes.

"Hi,

I have two levels of chapters, in a long document.

I generate an index, which spans multiple pages.

I'd like each chapter, and its subchapters, to be kept on the same page (so that
the subchapters are strongly associated, with their parent chapter title -this
is for a particular technical book, for which the index is especially important,
and I want maximum readability).


For the Â«Contents 1Â» paragraph style, I simply use the Â«Keep with next
paragraphÂ» option. However, for Â«Contents 2Â», I cannot do this, as the last
subchapter would be kept with the next Â«Contents 1Â», meaning the whole index
would be linked together, and OOo would split it as if the option was not set.


A new option should be created, in the paragraph styles, Â«Text FlowÂ» tab,
Â«OptionsÂ» section, which would be named Â«Keep with same paragraphsÂ» (or Â«Keep
with sibling paragraphsÂ», if you want to keep the family metaphor, used for the
orphan/widow control -although CSS and XSL use Â«siblingÂ», as Â«same levelÂ», and
not as Â«same level *AND* same kind of elementÂ»).

If activated, it would keep together, same paragraphs. In my case, the Â«Contents
2Â» paragraphs, meaning, all the subchapters of a specific chapter. Then, they
will be followed by the next chapter, as a Â«Contents 1Â» paragraph, before which,
OOo could insert an automatic page break.


For example:

A  -> Contents 1 -> Keep with next paragraph
A1 -> Contents 2 -> Keep with same paragraphs
A2 -> Contents 2 -> Keep with same paragraphs
A3 -> Contents 2 -> Keep with same paragraphs
(possible page break, as B is not the same kind of paragraph as A3)
B  -> Contents 1 -> Keep with next paragraph
B1 -> Contents 2 -> Keep with same paragraphs
B2 -> Contents 2 -> Keep with same paragraphs
B3 -> Contents 2 -> Keep with same paragraphs



For the index, the current workaround is to edit the index manually, to add

can therefore perform a simple string search and replace and then save the

This has been working fine using older versions of OpenOffice (2.0.2), however

the organsation to globally change the look of all their documents with having
to manually fix each individiually.

OOo should have an option to force the user to use styles and locks-out all the
other layout controls. This could be on a per template, per document, or per
installation basis. The option should should also include the capability to
disallow blank lines, and limit the amount of boldface/italic/underline per
style per element.

if sentence 1 and sentence 2 from one contiguous change and you like sentence 1

"Hello,

I am writing my thesis in OpenOffice (2.4.1 and 3.0.0 Beta2), and have found a
100% reliable way to have OO writer permanently hang (I have waited up to 8
minutes, and have to kill program with task manager). I have attached a minimal
document which causes this problem.

Steps to reproduce failure:
1. Open attached document (disable macros on load.. I tried writing a macro for
something, but have since deleted them, but it still asks).
2. Move your cursor to the start of the main line of text inside the frame.
3. Type 'a a a a a a a a ' till the line exceeds the width of the page. For me,
the program then locks up totally.

I have found that by deleting the formula (which is actually a real formula for
my thesis), the problem goes away. Also, if I change the formula to be just 'a',
it also goes away. Therefore I suspect there is some interaction between the
formula and the line wrap. There could also be an issue with the frame it is in.

My setup is:
- OpenOffice 2.4.1 and 3.0.0 Beta2
- Windows XP Pro [5.1.2600]
- 4Ghz Intel P4 with hyperthreading.
- 3gig ram.
- Only one OpenOffice document open at the time.

"i had posted on problems with anchors in an earlier bug
(http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=6515) but i think although i
was extremely frustrated (enough to go the point of filing an issue), i still
was way too ambiguous to be helpful, and the bug got invalidated. it was
suggested that i post to the users mailing list.

since then, i have posted a similar message on problems with anchors to the
users mailing list (on 10/18/2002, under '[users] problems with anchors:
HELP!!!') but did not (at least as of 10/22) get a single response. so i am
posting here.

in total, i have spent several days either trying to work around this problem,
or to figure it out and document it.  i hope the post is helpful.

INTRO

basically, i am trying to get OOo to act like LaTeX does with 'figure floats':
the figure will be automatically placed (in the final document) as close to the
'anchor point' (place in original text document) as possible. if the latex
compiler figures out that it must move the figure to the next page, then the
resulting blank space (at end of first page) is *filled* with succeeding
paragraphs by moving them up in front of the graphic appearing at top of page two.

OOo does NOT do this (except only fleetingly -- see below). instead, OOo leaves
a big blank space after the anchored paragraph at end of first page. there are 3
other problems/bugs which, in combination with the first bug, can make it
extremely frustrating for a user.  furthermore, these bugs are tedious to
isolate and document. however, it is worth the effort because of this high level
of frustration.

bugs like these can be the the death-knell of a user confidence in OOo. in my
case, i need to do a dissertation. i was using latex, but wanted to use OOo
because it really is (potentially) highly superior in some ways, and yet still
implements the basic IDEA of latex (by implementing 'styles').

i also had high hopes for the future of OOo: if someday, OOo/SO made a deal with
Adobe for a PDF bridge, i might be able to someday create a *structured* PDF
document (complete with bookmarks and hyperlinks preserved).

now, i realize, unless some fixes are implemented rather quickly, chances are
slim that i will be able to use OOo for my dissertation. i am submitting these
bugs, however, in the hopes that fixing them will remove one more stumbling
block to users wanting to use OOo in the future.

the documentation on anchors also needs some fleshing out. even little things
like: 'i see an anchorpoint between paragraph 5 and 6: does that mean it is
anchored to paragraph 5? or to 6?' would be really helpful to the user. i
suppose i should post to the docs group, too... *sigh*.. :) :)

the bugs are below. to follow them, open up the attachment
(anchor_bug_example.sxw) and follow the directions. it's probably not a perfect
description of the problems, but hopefully it gets you into the ball-park close
enough to be helpful.

finally, thanks to the OOo team for all your hard work.

=====

BUG ONE: blank space between anchorpoint and frame itself at ends of
pages

step 1: (done already, in document 'anchor_bug_example.sxw')

suppose i have a graphic in a frame. frame is set for 'No Wrap', and
is anchored to paragraph 6. graphic is 4' high and 5.2' wide. (i am
working with a US Letter formatted page.)

now if the anchorpoint paragraph ends less than 4' from the bottom of
the page, then OOo will shift the graphic frame itself to the second
page. all this is *fine*, so far.

BUT, the problem is that now, OOo leaves the whole rest of the first
page, *after* the anchorpoint (paragraph 6), *blank*!

that is, what it *should* (IMHO) do (and what LaTeX does) is move text
from paragraph 7 UP from page 2, to fill in the less-than-4'-of-space
after paragraph 6 at the bottom of page 1, so that there isn't any
blank space at the end of page 1.

=====

BUG TWO: any filled-in space is forgotten when document re-opened

step 2: now, with your mouse, left-click on the graphic frame
appearing at top of page 2. graphic frame is now selected and anchor
point also appears at top of paragraph 6 on page 1.

IMPORTANT: make sure you can see paragraphs 5 and 6 both in your
window.

now with your mouse, drag the anchor-point icon to paragraph 5 (one
paragraph earlier). now notice that OOo *does* fill in the blank space
at end of page 1 with subsequent paragraphs 6, 7, and 8, even though
the graphic still appears at top of page 2.

this is EXACTLY the behavior i am intending. unfortunately, :( :( it is
only fleeting:

step 3: save document. close and reopen document. notice that
paragraphs 6, 7, and 8 have now moved back down to page two. OOo
forgot the fill-in that it did before saving. :( the blank space has
returned. :(

=====

BUG THREE: view does not auto-scroll while dragging anchor-point icon

step 3: now, suppose you want to get the anchor point back down to
paragraph 6 again, from para. 5, where it is now. how to do this?

select frame again so anchorpoint icon appears. now, scroll back up so
you can see the anchor point icon which is showing at beginning of
para. 5. THIS IS IMPORTANT: be sure you scroll up far enough so
that OOo's window no longer shows the graphic frame itself. that is,
you cannot see page 2. this represents the case where the user's
monitor -- at current zoom value -- is too small to fit in both the
anchorpoint, the blank space, the new page and the graphic all at same
time.

step 4: now try to drag the anchor point icon down to paragraph 6 on
page 2. it is impossible, because in order to drag it down to
paragraph 6, you have to get to page 2, but page 2 is beyond the
visible window.

it's not unreasonable for the user to expect OOo to 'auto-scroll' the
view down to page 2, in order to move the anchorpoint icon down
there. however, this does not happen, and the view does not move.

=====

BUG FOUR: anchorpoint icon lost while dragging beyond page

furthermore, dragging the anchorpoint icon above or below the limits
of the window causes the user to lose control of the anchorpoint icon:
even while mouse left-button is still pressed down, the anchorpoint
icon no longer moves: moving beyond the borders of the view has
severed the connection to the anchorpoint icon.


fortunately, i found two workarounds for BUGS THREE and FOUR:

1) reduce zoom to a point where you *can* see the anchorpoint and
frame both.

step 5: reduce zoom to 'Entire Page'. (View | Zoom | Entire Page).

now you can move anchor points around, but again, only within the
limits of the view

OR

2) drag the graphic frame itself instead of the anchorpoint.
anchorpoint will follow, one paragraph at a time, EVEN beyond limits
of current view (page will auto-scroll, as expected).

IMHO, however, even with these 2 workarounds, this still represents a
bug (or at least highly undesirable behavior for the user): dragging
an anchorpoint should have the same amount of flexibility as dragging
the frame itself: if auto-scroll works for the frame, it should work
for the anchorpoint icon, as well.","ENHANCEMENT"

duplicates it (e.g. 'As Gates(2014) said, openofice is a perfect replacement for

But, if a user chooses to change it, it does not looses the link with the
others. Maybe the interface to add the entry should also be modified. It should
allow to select the reference entry (combobox from reference list) and change
the reference text in a textbox. This way, there would be no need to uses
different GUI for adding or editing ref's entries.

"This is somewhat related to 
Issue#: 5182 (dropdown zoombox)
but I think I can't reopen an issue.

First of all, I was also confused how 'complicated' it is to change the zoom 
factor of the current document, missing the ms-word-like dropdown-box. but 
Issuezilla showed me I was wrong, you implemented it in the status bar, a nice 
place, I agree. But as notebook touchpad user, this are still too many clicks 
to adjust zoom:

CURRENT:
- right click the status bar zoom percentage area
- release right button to see list of zoom factors
- move pointer to select correct zoom factor (in most cases full page or 
optimal, which are the bottom ones, someone thought there, very nice ;)
- left or right click (and release) to select

I expect other fast touchpad workers will agree with me that this are still 
much to many interactions compared with a dropdown-like handling:

EXPECTED:
- left down
- move pointer to select factor (while button/touchpad is pressed)
- release

I like this behaviour more than the current one even with a scrollwheel mouse 
(just one button down, move, release, no excessive 'clicking'), but especially 
for touchpads, where you usually have different methods to press the right and 
left mouse button (e.g. left button directly via pad, right click usually a 
corner or, even worse, an ugly button you have to lift your pad finger to click 
or use the other hand) the other behaviour would be much more convenient.

This also leads to a short cross reference to Issue#: 5201 (mouse wheel 
zooming / placing of objects), which was, as far is I found out, not reopened, 
but I am also in need of the described feature:

<cut #5201>
However, the feature is not that useful now, for two reasons:
- the zoom should also pan the drawing, so that the pointer position
remains unchanged during the zoom
- holding CTRL causes snap function not to work

comments from studalk Sat Mar 19 18:49:51 +0000 2005 on issue 13507

i think the behaviour to justify the line before a line break (shift return) is
totally wrong. Typography suggests (strongly) that the spacing between words
should not be larger than the line spacing.
Assume you have 4 words in the line you want to end with a line break. Now think
of MS Word behaviour that drives these 4 words out to width of a ca. 15cm . This
is nothing but really ugly.

Furthermore if i want a line break in my text, i also want the reader to see
that there is a line break. If OO.org now also justifies this line, the new line
will be barely visible. Except if there is the above described huge, ugly word
spacing.

The argument that MSWord does it in this way is no argument at all. As far as I
know Tex does it the way OO.org used to do (in the old versions).

2. 
[] Expand manually broken lines

3.

"Editable footnote/endnote separators for Writer

Actually OpenOffice Writer doesn't allow other separators between main text and
footnotes/endnotes but the straight line. It is not quite critical. However, 

(1) changing, for example, a straight line by a waved one could help obtaining
some interesting and stylish typografic effects. 

(2) some periodicals (in humanities at least) require the authors to use not
footnotes but endnotes with a corresponding heading before them. It will be more
correct from the structural point of view if this heading was described as
something, which has a relation to endnotes, not to the main text. 

(3) it's worth mentioning, that MS Word allows tweaking of footnote/endnote
separator since the earliest versions, so those migrating to OpenOffice from
proprietary text editors may be used to such capability. 

It would be quite good if the OpenOffice team have included the possibility to
use custom footnote/endnote separators in forecoming versions of the program.","ENHANCEMENT"

"As an introduction, I will copy the content of the mail I posted on the discuss 
an dev list:




I have the following problem in Writer:




* What I want to achieve:




putting a background image/graphic/drawing on all pages; this


image/graphic/drawing is larger than the text area (to be precise,


it's as big as the whole page); the background should be present


on all pages, mirrored in even (or odd) pages




* What I tried so far, and why it didn't work:




1. setting it up as page background


   doesn't work because (1) I cannot put SXD drawings there


   [solved exporting to EMF] (2) the background graphics is either


   scaled or cropped to fit within the text area and (3) I could


   not find a way to reflect it on even (or odd) pages




2. including it as an OLE object


   (let's not talk about this experience ... couldn't even force


   the correct size ...)




3. including it as a Draw object cutting and pasting from Draw


   doesn't work because (1) I cannot replicate it on every page


   without adding it manually each time (2) I cannot set it to


   mirror automatically on even (or odd) pages




4. including it as a Graphic


   doesn't work because (1) I cannot put SXD drawings there


   [solved exporting to EMF] (2) I cannot replicate it on every


   page without adding it manually each time.




So the question can be reduced to one of these alternatives:




(1) is there a way to set up an auto-mirroring, out-of-margin page


background?




or




(2) is there a way to set up an auto-replicating (page-anchored,


of course) object?




It is my understanding that neither of these can be currently


achieved, so I think that an enhancement request might be apt.




This feature is very important, and can be reduced to the following request: 
page background (whether colour or image, is not important) should have margins 
independent from the text area. The concept should be generalized to the concept 
of 'page watermark', with the following options:




(1) possibility to choose a background colour *and* a background picture


(2) possibility to set the shading of the colour and picture to anything between 
0% and 100%


(3) margins independent from the text area


(4) option to automatically reflect the watermark on odd/even pages.




An important example of application is the creation of a pleading template (for 
the USA) or an Italian 'carta uso bollo', very important for legal applications.

2) The equation is nestled to a lower order of hierarchy. (Markup does not
deepen the nestling hierarchy)
3) The equation editor becomes more intuitive. To use the current method, users
must master an additional markup language.

http://aoclife.ddo.jp/~vuhung/foss/ooo/patches/OOO300m2.Writer.zoom.slow.odt

Hi all,

I notice a problem as described in the email title.
I am not sure it is a bug so I post here, please verify if it in your
environment

How to reproduce:

1. Open OOO300 m2 Writer onWindows
2. Open any document( I copy some mixed and and graphics from a website)
3. Push the '-' and '+' button on the right-bottom of Writer to zoom
See: http://flickr.com/photos/vuhung/2821210158/sizes/o/

Expected result: Pages get zoomed smoothly.
Actual result:
 Writer stops responding for about 5 seconds, then get zoomed correctly.
 FYI, In my test( see the picture above), during the time when Writer hangs,
 the note( the yellow box) on the right  collapsed into 2 rectangles.
 Sorry I couldn't take a screenshot with PrintScreen, but I will do
it later with a camera.

My environment:
Windows XP SP3 Japanese, Celeron 3.0GHz, 1GB RAM.
OOO3m2 build 9343, CWS:localisation30 Vietnamese.

I have reproduced it on my home computer using the attached file.

Applications who are calling for example the wordprocessor in openoffice, will

Officetalks only saves the document when you return from the closed
wordprocessor, but it thinks that openoffice quickstart is the same as
the wordprocessor and it is active for updating the document,  so it
won't save the document in the database.

Please fix this by making a difference between openoffice quickstart
and the wordprocessor so Officetalk will not be fooled again.

"When preparing a long document, styles are useful. But when changing a style's
elements (font, size, kerning, etc.), especially a whole bunch of elements,
knowing how changing will affect the document's total length would be very
helpful. A behind-the-scenes calculation without displaying the look would save
time and would show whether a combination actually lengthens when a doc is
already too long. That's a common layout problem.

For example, suppose you've carefully crafted a slew of photo captions to just
fit exactly. You're told to switch fonts. Rather than try out a bunch of
font-and-size combinations and look at every single photo caption in a 50-page
memo with every style change, it would be nice if one could specify an alternate
style definition and have OOo tell us if no caption would be longer than it is.

This could be tried on a sample user-typed text in a dialog or on all instances
of the style in the file. We'd want to know if the effect is to shorten, to
lengthen, or indeterminate, where indeterminate would be explicitly defined as
plus or minus some small percentage with a suggestion that the user examine all
indeterminate instances. Telling us that it is shortening or lengthening by a
percentage would be even more helpful; for instance, a shortening by 40% might
be too much.

If it lets us visit each instance of the style in the document by hopping from
one to the next without having to see what's in between, we can see the effect
immediately. The Find function may already have the necessary code to do that.
Then, if we can flag any instance of a style, we can revisit those that looked
bad and skip the ones that were okay.

Not calculated would be hand-tuned character strings, such as a different font
for one character. By saying they're not calculated, you could pre-explain
anomalous results. A bonus would be Writer identifying where hand-tuning seems
to have been performed, and judging effects only on all other noncontiguous
instances of the style.

"I am a scientist.  My bread and butter are scientific papers and grant 
proposals.  To do this writing absolutely requires proper attribution, full 
references.  Openoffice/staroffice are of limited use to me and any 
scientist/academic/researcher because it lacks something that Word and 
Wordperfect have: reference management capability.  Granted, the 
wordprocessors themselves do not contain this ability, but they do provide the 
handles necessary for superb applications like EndNote to use to handle the 
heavy lifting.  The ONLY wordprocessor in the linux world that can do this is 
Lyx, or if you are particularly masochistic, straight LaTex with bibtex.   
  I cannot emphasize this enough.  The lack of the ability to insert 
references and generate reference pages for publication of professional 
scientific (or other research) papers renders Openoffice all but useless to 
academics, students and professors/techs alike.  I only use Openoffice for 
minor tasks (letter writing or generation of curriculum vitae) and some 
presentations.  If I want to write a scientific paper or proposal, I use Lyx.  
ALL my colleagues use Word or Wordperfect on the PC or Mac because of the 
availability of EndNote. 
  The other day I gave an Impress presentation to some colleagues.  They were 
intrigued by my use of linux for general purpose and, in particular, my use of 
Openoffice. They asked me questions about its usability, commented on its 
similarity to what they are familiar with on Windows or the Mac vis a vis 
Office, and asked me about my thoughts on it.  These were potential adoptors.  
I ultimately had to tell them that the fact that neither Openoffice nor its 
sibling Staroffice can in any way properly manage references.  Not itself and 
not through a third party app.  Thus, I had to advise them against the 
application because it simply is not suited for scientific writing in any way.   
  This is a shame and ultimately unnecessary.  Openoffice and Staroffice COULD 
handle this critical function, either by providing handles or pipes the way 
Lyx, Word, and Wordperfect do (allowing the use of third party apps like 
pybliographic and Endnote respectively) or it could gain this function 
directly.  The suite does have a bibliography function though it is ultimately 
useless.  This function could/should be revamped, perhaps adopt bibtex as its 
native reference management method?  Either build a pybliographic/EndNote 
capability into Openoffice directly or provide the pipes/handles so that third 
party developers could easily support Openoffice/Staroffice with their 
applications.","FEATURE"

TextFieldMaster.User allows to specify a 'value' of type double (purpose?), 
a 'content' of type string which is the displayed value and a boolean.

Would it be difficult to extend this by a variable 'hiddenContent' of type 
string.

This way applications could store variables in the document and display them in 
the form the user decides.

e.g. the string would be something like:
<pd><name>John Smith</name><initials>JS</initials></pd>

At first insertion by the application the document would show only 'John 
Smith'. After a switch the application would be able to go through all the 
variables and exchange the shown value to the initials 'JS'.

Or whatever a different application would want to decide to store and display. 
This would be very flexible.

You could further enhance the flexibility by providing a 'changable' boolean 
field - if the user himself is able to change the displayed string and 
a 'plugin' string field, which leads to a notification of a registered 
plugin/application if the user clicks the field.

I know I can do this by removing the flag of the checkbox in 
'format -> paragraph -> textfloating -> breaks / insert / page'
but think this a little hard to find, complicated and not intuitive so there
should be an _additional_ (not replacement) method by using one of the 'usual'
keyboard actions for 'removing something'.","ENHANCEMENT"
"I strongly urge that OOo reconsider its keyboard shortcuts (especially in 
Writer and Calc) and simply comport with what Microsoft has already 
established. Given that MSOffice has over 90% marketshare (and has had it for 
virtually 10 years), why not simply let users start with the Microsoft keyboard 
shortcuts, or at the very least, make it an option choice as TextPad 
(www.textpad.com) does: 'Keystroke compatibility': and then there's a dropdown 
list in which the user can select TextPad's, IBM's, Microsoft's, or other 
keyboard shortcut schemes. It's so simple it's brilliant.

I notice that even though quite a few shortcuts are similar, I can't, for 
example, navigate using the Ctrl-arrow keys like I can in MS applications. I 
can't think of a reason why not. Among the biggest reason is that by 
correlating keyboard shortcuts, users and companies are able to migrate to OOo 
without the (albeit minor) headache of learning new keystrokes. Adobe, as 
wonderful a company as they are, does this to aggravation, with seemingly no 
rhyme or reason to their shortcuts in much of Acrobat, for example. 

Otherwise, if it's left as it is now, I'm left pining away for the good old 
days of when I could quickly bound around a document without having to futz 
with my mouse, thus slowing me down.","ENHANCEMENT"
"Selecting a paragraph and choosing 'Format | Default' does not revert the numbering to what is specified in the style.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a paragraph style with no numbering, call it 'NoNumber'
2. Write a paragraph and switch to style 'NoNumber'
3. Set the numbering on the paragraph to something new (without modifying the style)
4. Choose 'Format | Default'
5. The numbering remains on the paragraph

Conversely, if it is suspected this is a workaround error, the 'possible workaround' of choosing Number Format | Remove (via right-click) doesn't work as intended -- this is because it can remove the numbering that is supposed to be associated with the paragraph (via the style).

Basically there is no one-step fashion to revert several paragraphs, or even just one, to the numbering as defined in the style.

"Currently the 'Page Count' field retrieves the number of pages in the entire document.  This is not a useful behaviour when a document contains many different page styles and involves page renumbering (that is, if you wish to show X of Y page count on the bottom of a page, you cannot do this with the 'Page Count' field).

I would like to request a 'Relative Page Count' field that is capable of producing the correct page numbers with repest to renumbering.

Example.
Pages 1: Title page, First Page Style, Logical Number=1
Pages 2-3: Contents pages, Body Style, Logical Numbers=1-2
Pages 4-10: Body pages, Body Style, Logical Numbers=1-6
Pages 11-12: Index pages, Index Page Style, Logical Numbers=1-2

The desired counting field 'Relative Page Count', by example would be:
Page 1: (Not seen, hidden)
Page 2:  Page i of ii
Page 4:  Page 1 of 6
Page 11: Page a of b

Currently you can only achieve the following (unless there is something I'm unaware of) using 'Page Count'
Page 1: (Not seen, hidden)
Page 2: Page i of xii
Page 4: Page 1 of 12
Page 11: Page a of m

"Ecco outlining is as close to WYSIWG as any outliner I've seen and it would be 
GREAT if Writer could eventually incorporate this ability. If so, it would make 
it a MUST-HAVE app for all writers and editors. Below is an extended 
description of its functionality as I remember from a great PIM program 
called 'Ecco Pro' a few years back.

Some applications apparently use 'outlining' to mean 'organizing information
in hierarchies', and use various kinds of presentations and operations
derived from their interpretations of this. In Ecco, an outline can be created,
edited, and viewed as a document in outline form. (In this description,
I'm purposely ignoring the many useful things that can be done with items in
an Ecco outline, in order to focus on this aspect. Also, I focus on the
most common and basic operations on outlines -- the ones that will be 'at
your fingertips' when you've gotten some experience with the application.)

The unit of outlining is the 'item', which is roughly equivalent to a paragraph 
in a word processing application. It contains rich text, possibly including 
embedded newlines, and can be of indefinite length. The usual tools are 
available for editing text in an item (which is done in place in the outline, 
without losing any visibility to the neighboring items): cut/copy/paste, Ctrl-B 
to make text bold, Ctrl-I for italic, etc. Menu items are available to change 
font, size, style, and color.  All font settings can be made down to the 
character level.

You begin with a blank 'notepad', which looks like a sheet of ruled paper.
Click on the first blank line, and a small bullet appears, with the cursor
placed to its right.  After typing the item, you can press Ctrl-Enter to begin 
the next item at the same level (Shift-Enter to embed a newline in the same 
item), Ctrl-R to begin a new item at the next level down, or Ctrl-L to
begin a new item at the next higher level (if the item's not at the top
level).  (You can use these when on any item, to insert a new one after
the current one.)  The outline structure is shown by indentation in the
usual way.

If the currently selected item already has a child, pressing Enter will
insert a new child before it; pressing Ctrl-Enter will insert a new item
at the same level as the current one, after all its children.  (If the
current item doesn't have children, Enter will insert a new item at the same
level.)

Outlines can be collapsed and expanded, either globally (all items at a
given level) or locally (subitems of the currently selected one). Hold
down the Ctrl key while pressing a digit (1 through 9), and all items at that
level and below (in the entire outline) will be hidden.  With an item
selected, hold Ctrl and Shift to get the same effect, but only on that
item's children.  For convenience, Ctrl-H is the same as Ctrl-Shift-1
(hide all descendants), Ctrl-J is the same as Ctrl-Shift-2 (show only
immediate children), and Ctrl-G will expand all descendants of the item.

To move an item up or down a level, use the Alt-LeftArrow and Alt-RightArrow
keys.  Alt-UpArrow and Alt-DownArrow keys move an item up or down with
respect to its siblings at the same level.  (In all these moves, the
children of the item move with it.)  An item can also be moved with the
mouse anywhere in the outline, at any level, by 'grabbing' the small
bullet and dragging it.  As the mouse moves, a small indicator will become
visible in each place where the item can be 'dropped', to make it clear what the
effect of releasing the mouse button will be.  If several items are selected, 
they can be moved as a unit by grabbing any one of their bullets. To cancel the 
drag operation, return the mouse to the item you started at and release.

As with text, entire items may be deleted, cut, copied, and pasted.  To select 
an item, click to the left of its bullet.  To select several items, click and 
drag, or hold down Shift while pressing the up or down arrow keys.  Also, as 
with most text editors, Ctrl-Shift-End will select all items from the current  
to the last, and Ctrl-Shift-Home from the current to the first.

Items may be split or joined.  To split an item, put the cursor in it at some 
point and press Ctrl-Shift-S; the text after the cursor will become a new item 
just after the current one.  (As with pressing Enter, the new item will become 
the first child of the current one if there's already a child; otherwise it'll 
become the next sibling.)  To join a sequence of items, select them all and 
press Ctrl-Shift-J; their test will be pasted together, separated by spaces, 
and appended to the first item.  (These operations can't be undone.)","FEATURE"

We've confirmed the crash with OOo 3.0 on Linux and Windows XP. 2.4.0 is the
earliest version we've tested that has the crash. On 2.2.0 we were unable to
reproduce the crash. 2.3 was not tested.

If you want to reproduce the crash yourself:

== Steps 1.-4. for LINUX (for Windows, see further below) ==

1. Download http://forge.osor.eu/frs/download.php/139/WollMux.uno.pkg

2. Download
http://forge.osor.eu/frs/download.php/138/wollmux-config-utf8-4.8.0.tar.gz

3. cd $HOME

4. tar xzf wollmux-config-utf8-4.8.0.tar.gz

== Steps 1.-4. for WINDOWS (for Linux, see further above) ==
1. Download http://forge.osor.eu/frs/download.php/139/WollMux.uno.pkg

2. Download
http://forge.osor.eu/frs/download.php/137/wollmux-config-iso8859-1-4.8.0.zip

3. Extract wollmux-config-iso8859-1-4.8.0.zip to the folder that contains your
personal Desktop folder. On a German Windows XP that is C:\Dokumente und
Einstellungen\<login_id>

4. If you've done this correctly, then you will have (on a German Windows XP) a
file C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\.wollmux\wollmux.conf

== Next steps are the same for Linux and Windows ==
5. Start OpenOffice.org

6. Open Tools/Extension Manager and add the downloaded WollMux.uno.pkg

7. Close OpenOffice.org (including quickstarter) and then start it again

8. Open an empty writer document. You should get the WollMux dialog

Currently, there is a problem with style naming in OO: you can't change the name once the style has been

"It is clear that in a text processor images have to move, when the anchor is
moved, because that is what an anchor is good for. The anchor is part of the
text and lets the image move with the text.
But it is logical absolutely necessary, that the anchor has to stay where it is,
when the user moves the image, because when it does not, the user never can have
a real control over the relative position between image an anchor. 

In Writer, if you have text with breaks, the anchor automaticaly jumps to the
nearby break, if users move a images. I attach a photo of a textpage, where you
can see, that this is in somecase absolutely wrong behavior. If I have a page
like this in a larger document, I make a page-break bevor the title, so that the
page keeps its shape. I put the images on the page, befor I put in text, so that
the anchors are all on top (see red lines). Whatever textchanges I make now, the
images stay at their position as they have to. So the page is perfect done. 
The bug is: 
If I move one image one milimeter now, the anchor jumps over the whole page to
the nearby text-brake. This is a useless automatic, because if the user wants
the image conected to another point of the text, he will move the anchor not the
image. Now image position is instabile when text changes. And the program gives
me no chance to get the anchor back to the top of the page where it has to be in
this case. Even text-frames are no solution, because other formats do not read
them.  Give users the chance to disable this nonsense automatic (for example by

I am consistently unable to select a paragraph with the mouse. The text within

Hello, my Name is John[P]
[P]

If I move the paragraph {we have a full moon} using the CTRL+UP/DOWN it moves
properly. For instance, if I move it to the top of the page, it will place the
{we have a full moon} paragraph above the {Hello, my Name is John} paragraph. So
this is the result:

We have a full moon[P]
Hello, my Name is John[P]
[P]
[P]
[P]
[P]
[P]

However, if I select the text with the mouse, I am unable to select the
paragraph, but only the text within the paragraph. Selecting {We have a full
moon} using the mouse, then dragging the 'selected' paragraph to the top of the
page gives me this result:

We have a full moonHello, my Name is John[P]

"It would be extremely helpful if the font selector for Writer and any other
OO.org app that allows selection of fonts used a background color in the drop
down box that allowed for the differentiation of the fonts based on
proprietary/patented/copyrighted or copylefted, or free.  Two or three
background colors could be used for each font in the drop down box, for example
green could be used as a background font for FOSS or copylefted fonts, yellow
for shareware or some other mildly restricted fonts, and red for fonts that are
copyrighted/patented or may otherwise land a user or corporation in trouble
regarding licensing/royalties/BSA.

So, for example, I'm starting to write a letter, and use the fonts drop down box
to select a font, but I see that Times New Roman has a red or yellow background
(MS font, issue of suing or BSA threats on patent on Times New Roman murky
because of possible past promises to individuals not to sue, but no promises to
corporations...etc.,) so instead I choose a free-serif type font that has a
green background and is a known FOSS font as it has been donated to the FSF, etc.

Yellow could also be used if the font isn't known for sure to be FOSS or
proprietary/patent encumbered, or isn't in 'the' font database that would
accompany OO.org installation, or would be available/checked/ or updated from

When printing a multiple page document on a KonicaMinolta Bizhub C252 the DIN A4

The normal way of adjusting a line for full justification of text is to fill the line with complete spaces between the words.  This often results in a strange-looking line.

paper, as when the navigator is docked left or right, the document opens with

64 pixels from the left of the window. When using a 1024x768 screen with the
zoom set to 100%, the righthand edge of the text frame will often be outside the
window. This is inelegant.

As long as the available space in the window is wide enough to accommodate the
text frame, the text frame should be centered in the window, allowing the
margins of the page to extend outside the window as necessary. That way the user
can see what he or she is working on without manually adjusting the scroll of
the page (a minor waste of time, but one that repeated 100 times a day, 5 days a

An alternative would be to have documents remember their horizontal scroll

This is 'correct' operation (obviously don't want French checked against and

some words, perhaps all of them have not been checked because there is no

Also, who knows what language an imported document appears to be.
To the average user, the document is in 'English' and they have an 'English'
dictionary installed, so they expect it to work in some fashion.

For instance, as I am in New Zealand, it seems sensible to set the default
language to 'English (New Zealand)'.  However there is no specific NZ
dictionary, so the best I can do is install the Australian or GB dictionaries.

"Normaly without auto save, (and in almost any other application) one can open a
document to use as a template.  Then some time later, save it with another name.
 For me, I try to do this sooner rather than later so I don't forget and write
over the original.

The problem with the auto save is that it writes over the original.  So, like I
did, if you wait a while to save your document with a new name, your original is
lost.  

The other office applications auto write to a temporary file.  When the
application closes correctly it cleans up the temporary file.  When the
application first comes up, it looks for the existence of any temporary files. 
If it finds one, it rightfully thinks it crashed the last time.  It then prompts
the user to see if they want to recover from the crash, or if they want the temp
file to be deleted.

You may think this is a new feature request, but because this application works
contrary to any application I have seen with auto save, and every application
without it, (Because auto save should work quietly in the background and not be
noticed unless you need it) and creates data loss, I would argue that this is a
defect.

"When viewing multi-page documents, Microsoft Word allows you to click on the 
grey space between the pages to switch into a mode where all the top/bottom 
borders of the pages, the page number row, and the grey area between pages are 
not displayed anymore. This saves an enormous amount of space when working with 
documents, especially on resolutions like 1024*768. 

Unfortunately, OpenOffice does not offer such an option. The difference is 
huge, as demonstrated in attached screenshots: OO wastes a third of the screen 
space. Also, it is VERY annoying to work like this with multi-page documents 
whenever you approach page breaks.

Web Layout does not offer an alternative to this. This is needed when you work 
with a document that will eventually be printed (thus you need to work in print 
layout, not web layout), but is also viewed and worked with on the screen a lot.

Examples, for when this is needed:
- Writing a 100 page thesis: In the end the document will be printed, and while 
working on it you also need to take care of the layout. However, during all the 
months you work on it, you don't need to waste a third of your viewing space by 
seeing the page borders. They never change. It's extremely annoying, because 
you have to scroll up and down all the time, just to see what you wrote in the 
previous paragraph (because the space where you would see it is all occupied by 
page borders). Many of my fellow students switched back to MS Word because of 
this.

- Working on a long business document, that gets updated every week or so, and 
the current version of which is printed by management every couple of month. 
The situation is similar: The document only gets printed from time to time, but 
most of the time you work with it on the screen. Web Layout is no use here, 
because the document is for printing. 
In my company, I cannot recommend OO to laptop users because of this. Screen 
space is scarce and such a waste is not understandable. It makes people accept 
all the small disadvantages they hate about Word, just to not be confronted

"While creating numbered lists in OpenOffice.org 3 Writer the list numbers often
end up being a different point size than the text being entered.

Steps for Reproduction:

(1) Launch OpenOffice.org 3 Writer.
(2) Set the font to a value other than the default, such as 10-points.
(3) Click the Numbering On/Off button in the toolbar.
(4) Enter a few line-items of text.

You will note that the numbers in the list remain at the default value of
12-points. However, the text entered for each line item will be 10-points as
specified. This problem appears to occur without respect for specified Style.

Workaround:

In order to correct the font-size of the numbers, the user must select the
entire list and set the font size to be equal with that of the line item text
(e.g. 10-points) in order to correct the discrepancy in formatting.

Further Observations:

I have observed this issue in both Microsoft Windows 32-bit builds of
OpenOffice.org 3 and Linux 64-bit builds as well. 

If the ODF Text file is saved, the file closed and then opened the formatting
issues are still present. Therefore, this seems to be a problem with how the
numbered lists are being written to the file, not simply a display issue.

Also, if the numbered list is exported to another file format besides ODF Text
(e.g. .DOC) and contains numbered lists in a font size other than the default of
12-points (e.g. 10-points, set with the workaround described above) it will
seemingly at random set the list numbers back to the default of 12-points every
time the file non-ODF file is written to.

I have not tried to reproduce this issue outside of Writer. It may be present in
Calc, Impress, etc.

"This might apply to things other than Writer - it's the only one I have had the 
opportunity to test.

If I create a new document in writer, I can create furigana (the proper name 
for these in Japanese) with no problems at all. 

However, if I load an MSWord .doc file that contains them, it messes up. They 
correct characters are displayed, but rather than appearing directly above the 
line they are attached to, they appear at a much greater distance. They 
actually overlap the main text of the previous line, which makes the whole 
thing quite hard to read.

Saving the file as an .ODT and then loading that file does not fix the issue. 
Whatever the problem is seems to be saved aswell. Adjusting fonts doesn't help. 

Cutting and pasting text between a properly working .odt and a broken .doc/.odt 
results in a variety of strange behaviors. .doc -> .odt often results in the 
spacing being fixed, but the furigana being the same size as the main 
line. .odt -> .doc often results in the text acquiring the defective spacing. 
unlike text originating in the .doc, however, if that text is cut&pasted back 
into a working .odt, it goes back to displaying properly. There seems to be 
some differances depending on whether it's being cut & pasted into an existing 
line, or onto a new line.

Unfortunately, so far as I've been able to tell, there is no manual way to 
change the spacing, and thus no way to fix it. Apparently, the pronunciation 
guide is considered 'formatting' and is lost if text is selected, and 'clear 
formatting' selected. This, incidentally, is moronic. Furigana are content, not

The fact that there are 2 pages in web layout and the OLE stands in the second

However the original bug that I wanted to report (which is not getting

never shows up and so has an affinity to the first slide only (though while
editing it showed the second slide).

"The attached doc (DCBugs.odt) shows some kerning problems I ran into, using the
Times New Roman font with drop caps. When the letter after the drop cap is 'a',
the kerning sometimes allows the two glyphs to overlap, as (IMHO) they should,
but the rendering of the 'a' glyph wipes out the overlapping part of the drop
cap (which, IMHO, it shouldn't). More details are in the document itself.

This is only P4, and probably should get 'while you're in the code' status.  It
would be P5, since it's only about 'pretty', but that's all that drop caps are
about: 'pretty'.

me to do it? While pre-scanning for duplicate issues, I found more than a dozen
P3 and P4, 3.x, OO.later issues related to drop caps, and I only looked at the

"OpenOffice Prl Parsing Heap Overflow Vuln  Test version: Version 3.0.0 OOO300m9 Build 9358 on Windows XP  Description:  1. Abstract There is a heap overflow problem in OpenOffice which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. The Heap overflow issues exist within the code responsible for parsing Prl in a DOC file. This allows an attacker to overflow heap memory with data they supplied. Files in MS-DOC format store the properties of characters, paragraphs, tables, pictures, and sections as lists of differences from the default. A Prl specifies each difference. It consists of a Single Property Modifier (Sprm) and its operand.   by the way : where could I upload the demo vuln files?   2. Structures a) Prl Sprm2 Bytes operandvariableDepending on the content of Sprm b) TDefTableOperand When Sprm is â€œ0xD608â€?, it means the operand followed is TDefTableOperand cb2 BytesThe number of bytes used by the remainder of this structure, plus one NoC1 ByteNumber of columns, [0, 63] rgdxaCenter[]variableArray of XAS which size is 2 bytes, for every column, so there is (NoC + 1) XAS rgTc80[]variableArray of rgTc80 structure which size is 20 bytes c) Tc80 tcgrf2 Bytes wWidth2 Bytes brcTop4 Bytes brcLeft4 Bytes brcBottom4 Bytes brcRight4 Bytes  3. Details When process the Prl chain, the program read each Prl and judge the Sprm to determine to use which function. If the Sprm is â€œ0xD608â€? which means the operand is TDefTableOperand, it calls the ReadDef function. CODELINE.  In the function ReadDef, it â€œnewâ€? a pointer pTCs for rgTc80 array which member count is determined by nCols variable (NoC). But when copy data to pTCs, it use the nFileCols variable in loop, which is calculated by cb. So if the nFileCols is greater than nCols, it will generate a heap overflow by memcpy. In WW8TabBandDesc:CODELINE.//Here, new a pTCs use nCols, which is CODELINE.  In my file, I construct a Prl data like this: {08 D6, 24 37, 03, {(3+1)*2 Bytes fill}, {4 Bytes fill}, {16 Bytes 0xaa}, {4 Bytes fill}, {16 Bytes 0xaa}, {4 Bytes fill}, {16 Bytes 0xaa}, {4 Bytes fill}, {16 Bytes 0xaa}, {4 Bytes fill}, {16 Bytes 0xaa}, â€¦} 08 D6 is Sprm; 24 37 is cb, can result nFileCols equal 0x2C1; 03 is NoC, can result nCols equal 0x3; the 0xaa will be filled in pTCs and cover heap.

points), then the minus remains a minus.

It is true that niqqud is not used much in Hebrew texts, but there's no reason
not to autoformat the minus as a dash after a word with niqqud.","DEFECT"

"When the cursor is in the replacement text of a Search/Replace menu it should accept anything that can be put into regular document text. However, if you Insert->Field-User Variable (or other field) at that point, the operation silently does nothing instead of inserting the field in the replacement text.

There should be a workaround: place the replacement text (including the field) in scratch space in the document and cut/paste the text to the replace menu. Unfortunately, while that should work, in fact a different bug (reported separately) causes the resulting replacement text to be the expansion of the field rather than the field itself.","ENHANCEMENT"

"ODF 1.0/1.1 documents containing a frame inside a shape produce an error when trying to open in OpenOffice.org 3.0 (and I think all other versions of OOo as well).  Steps to reproduce: ------------------- Not possible with OOo. Create a new document in Microsoft Word, insert a shape of any type and insert a picture inside the shape. Save the document to ODF using MS Office 2007 SP2 or the OpenXML/ODF Translator Add-in.  Expected behavior: ------------------ Even if OOo does not support the specific feature, Writer should be able to fail gracefully and open the valid ODF document (by simply ignoring the ODF features that are not supported by OOo).  Generally the input parser is already quite robust; however it should also be capable of opening documents created by other applications, especially when these documents only used features of ODF 1.0/1.1.

"I was working on a 'How to print envelopes using Open Office org' for my parents
on their new HP a6442p (has an Intel Dual core E2200) and had inserted a number
of screen shots of the Envelope dialog, then resized the images, then decided to
put them into a table.  This is when the problems began.  The images would not
cut and paste when I selected them with their accompanying text.  So I tried
dragging the anchor into the table cell.  This would work, but did not yeild the
results I wanted, so I tried switching the anchor type to 'As Character'.  This
resulted in the images being resized to VERY small even though the properties
still said they were the size I had made them.  Eventually I closed the document
because I needed to restart the system to get it to detect the memory card
reader so I could pull some more images from an xD card.  Now when I try to
reopen this document on that system, or my HP laptop (also running Vista, and

"In a Writer document, if a an URL is added that exceeds the available space on a

new line, it breaks and gets wrapped to the next line in seemingly arbitrary ways.

This behaviour creates large gaps in a text and is especially undesirable in
justified copy. It also contravenes most style guidelines, which demand that
URLs be broken at slashes.    

An improved default behaviour would be for URLs _not_ to start on a new line and
to be broken only after slashes and before punctuation. To avoid ambiguity, no
hyphen should be inserted when an URL gets broken.","ENHANCEMENT"
"Hello everybody!

1. Put text wrapping settings into Table Properties:

While working with OO I cannot get used to the fact that Table Properties lack
settings for text wrapping. From my point of view it is neither user-friendly
nor logical to not be able to set the text wrapping for a table in the table's
properties. Instead what one has to do at the moment is put the table into a
frame and look for text wrapping settings in the frame's properties.

2. Ability to select a row/column or the whole table with just one click.

I think that it is common to format the first ro in a table bold. However to do
this I have to drag the mouse all accross the line in order to select each cell
individually. Same with colum.
It would be useful to be able to point to the side of a row and by clicking be
able to select the whole row. The same for colums, when pointing above or just
below a column.
Adding to that dragging a table to a new position, as well as deleting it at
once would become much more user-friendly, if there was a way to select the
whole table with just one click, e.g. by pointing right next to a corner of it.

"Writer is freezing after loading a document.  The document was created in
Writer, saved in native odt format.  I have been working on the document for
several weeks.  After adding several pages of documentation, I saved the
document then shutdown.

On restart, the document loads, displays the current view where I left off
editing, but then freezes.  soffice.bin soars to 100% CPU utilization.  The
entire window is frozen, no refresh of any contents, including the menus, status
bar.

This happens in the following versions:
  Linux i586 RH9 - 2.4.2
  Linux i586 OpenSuse 11.1 - OOO300m9
  Linux i586 OpenSuse 11.1 - OOO300m15 Build 9379 (3.0.1)
  Windows Vista - 3.0.0 OOO300m9 Build 9358

Exact same behavior on all platforms, except that on windows, it detected a
crash, tried to generate a crash report, but that then froze creating the crash
report.

For a brief moment after displaying the current page of the document, I can
select text.  If I keep mouse down and drag, I can scroll through the entire
document.  After releasing the mouse, it freezes, and this time I have to switch
to a console (Ctrl-Alt-F1) to kill it, as the mouse in X is locked up.

Memory seems to stay static.

I tried all of the following to no effect:
 - disabling Java
 - disabling autosave
 - disable all writing aids
 - disabled update fields / charts
 - opening read-only,

After killing Writer and trying again, it always asks about trying to recover
the document.  Even in read-only mode, it tries to recover the read-only version.

I have been able to open the document in KOffice and immediately resave it in
ODT, and then I can successfully open it in Writer, but significant formatting
has been lost in the process.

"1st case: changes what effect the following pages

Do the following:
1) Open the file 'reverse problem with templates what effects the following 
pages'.
2) Place the cursor in the free space before the headline with '1' in the line 
on the first page.
3) Look at the frame at the end of the first page. You see a frame with four 
lines.
4) Press Enter. You see that two lines are moved to the next page. This is OK 
because of orphan widow control.
5) Delete the inserted line by pressing backspace. You see that the two lines 
don't come back so that the original document is not restored to the original 
layout.
6) Try to undo the inserted new line by pressing Ctrl-Z. You see that this does 
not work too. There is no normal way to get the original layout. Of course you 
can delete a second line and insert a line to restore the original layout. But 
this is not the way how it should work.

The main problem here is that you are normally not aware of the change because 
this effect can happen in a page what is not visible when you edit a page. You 
change something and undo the change and think that the document is in the 
original state. But some pages later the temporary change resulted in such a 
shift of lines to the next page. Sometimes this has the result that a graphic 
what is placed exactly at the end of a page does not fit on that page anymore 
is shifted to the next page too and destroys the whole layout.


2nd case: changes what makes a frame to look bad and are reversable with Ctrl-Z

Do the following:
1) Open the file 'reverse problem with templates what does NOT effect the 
following pages and what IS reversable with Ctrl-Z'
2) Go to the end of the second page. You see a green frame with four lines. 
Look at the margin at the end of the frame. The margin keeps some distance from 
the last line and looks good.
3) Go to the start of the second page and place the cursor at the start of the 
line 'PLACE THE CURSOR IN THIS LINE BEFORE THE â€žPâ€œ'.
4) Select the complete first page and delete it so that the line 'PLACE THE 
CURSOR IN THIS LINE BEFORE THE â€žPâ€œ' is the very first line of the first page.
5) Look at the margin at the end of the frame what is now on the first page. 
The margin doesn't keep some distance from the last line and doesn't look good 
anymore. By pressing Ctrl-Z you can restore the original layout including the 
margin.

The main problem here is that you are normally not aware of the change too. You 
edit something, look at the change and think that the change is good. Some 
pages later on a page what is not visible such a change happens. Only very 
later you detect that.

3rd case: changes what makes a frame to look bad and are NOT reversable with

"There are two subcases what are only slightly different. Both subcases end up 
in the same loss of the margin in the bottom of an outlined paragraph. That's 
why I think this is one case.

1st subcase: changes what makes an outlined paragraph to look bad and are 
reversable with Ctrl-Z

Do the following:
1) Open the file 'border line problem what IS reversable with Ctrl-Z'
2) Go to the end of the second page. You see an outlined paragraph with green 
background with four lines. Look at the margin at the end of the frame. The 
margin keeps some distance from the last line and looks good.

margin.

margin.png' and 'combined Screenshot making the difference visible.png'. If you 
cannot see a difference after removing the first page in the test file (you 
have to remove the complete page!) please open the last screenshot. This 
screenshot shows you the difference between the margins before and after the 
removal of the first page. This screenshot shows you moreover that nearly all 
distances between the borders have changed including the height of some borders 
as well. I was not aware of that until comparing these screenshots. The 
difference between two borders is only slight but you see that the overall 
difference increase the more borders you have.

The main problem here is that you are normally not aware of the change. You 
edit something, look at the change and think that the change is good. Some 
pages later on a page what is not visible such a change happens. Only very 
later you detect that.

2nd case: changes what makes an outlined paragraph to look bad and are NOT 
reversable with Ctrl-Z

Do the following:
1) Open the file 'border line problem what is NOT reversable with Ctrl-Z'
2) Repeat steps 2-4 as above.
3) Look at the margin at the end of the frame what is now on the first page.

The only 'workaround' for this is to (un)maximize the window to force zoom

"I have a document, a book to be more precise, that has beginning page numbers in
lower case roman numerals, and then restarts the numbering at 1 with regular
numerals when the main text starts.  This is very common in books.  The preface

When I create an alphabetic index, the roman numeral page numbers and the
regular page numbers show up, but they are sorted together as in the following
example.

Dog....2,x,15,xvi

It seems more intuitive and appropriate that they should be sorted as follows:

Dog....x,xvi,2,15

Or, at least have an option of which method one prefers, as this is the actual
order in which they are found within the book.

Perhaps this is another issue, but if one of the page styles has 'no number
format' then the index will look like this.  My table of contents, for example,
had no page number format for awhile, which in some cases may be wanted.

Dog....2, ,15,xvi

"To reproduce:

1. In Writer (without JRE (Java Runtime Environment)), create and save a file as
Text Encoded with charset 8859-1 and paragraphing as CR&LF.

2. Go somewhere to find qualifying strings. Suggested Web pages are mentioned
below and you might make and edit a file using a text editor like gedit 2.10.2
using UTF-8 and a hex editor like KHexEdit 0.8.6. You can paste into gedit and
verify with KHexEdit or, probably, you can type into gedit and, with KHexEdit,
delete an unwanted nonprinting character and move subsequent characters left one
position.

3. Find text strings that end in a hex 0A character or include in the middle a
hex 0D character but not both together.

4. Copy the string and paste into the Text Encoded document.

5. The text ending in a lone 0x0A will fail to paste.

6. Save. Close. Open. If the ASCII filter settings dialog asks if you want
paragraph breaking at CR, change to CR&LF (that being my default and I want
consistency). The text following the lone 0x0D will disappear.

7. Close (without saving). Reopen. If the ASCII filter settings dialog asks if
you want paragraph breaking at CR, leave it that way. The text following the
lone 0x0D will reappear.

I don't use JRE since it crashed my system, but, while I'm not able to use OOo
Base, I'm not sure it matters for this problem.

When closing and reopening a saved Text Encoded file that has been saved with
paragraph breaking at CR&LF and charset 8859-1, some content disappears. The
content lost is from a hex 0D to the end of the paragraph containing the
character; however, the loss is only if the hex 0D is not followed by hex 0A but
is followed by visible text. Preceding text is not affected. No warning of loss
is given by OOo; I only found out when I needed to reopen a file.

Closely related (and therefore in this report) is that when a text string is
followed by a space and the hex 0A character alone, the total string cannot be
pasted into the Text Encoded file. Pasting results in nothing appearing. It can,
however, be pasted into gedit, which is how I identified the hex character
involved (using a hex editor on the file saved in gedit), but copying from gedit
and into the Writer Text Encoded file fails. Thus, it doesn't matter from where
the string was originally copied (it was originally copied from
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=570931 (the string 'Add me to CC list'
but only when selected so as to include a trailing space)).

On the other hand, I discovered the hex-0D text-loss problem when copying text
from fields in the Bug Report Wizard at <https://bugs.opera.com/wizard/>, as
accessed Feb. 7, 2009. Their software apparently adds the 0x0d unsolicited when
I paste text into their field; I assume they need it for breaking paragraphs
within a field.

If, in Writer, a Save command is given without closing the file, text does not
disappear at the time of the save (it can be seen using a hex editor), although
it will still disappear later. I do not know if the disappearance relative to
Writer occurs upon closure or upon reopening, but all reopening was done without
having quit Writer and opening as read-only or read-write makes no difference.

If the file has been saved but has not been closed, it is possible to recover
the text that will be lost after closing by using Undo. Thus, Save per se does
not cause the loss.

In the hex 0D case, when text is lost while opening with CR&LF but recovered by
closing and reopening with only CR set for paragraph breaks, that is not a
permanent preservation. If the file is always opened as CR&LF and new text is
written at the place of loss, the file is saved and closed, the user quits OOo,
and Writer and the file are opened later, the lost content is permanently lost.

Expected behavior is that the Text Encoded format using CR&LF and 8859-1 will
ignore or delete the nonprinting characters, depending on the character, but not
delete any visible characters. It should not add hex 0A to a lonely hex 0D or
vice versa, lest that change the page layout by creating a new paragraph break
not in the original.

(Recovering data: Tangential note: If you're losing data and want it back, try
closing without writing or saving, then reopening with the filter settings at
whatever the file wants, such as CR or LF. If that doesn't work, try the other
setting. If that displays what you want, save-as to a new file name, close, and
reopen. If that succeeded, delete the file you no longer need.)

"If you change a picture with a filter, e.g. using the Sharpen tool, then these
changes cannot be undone once you've saved a document and re-opened it, or after
the undo cache has been cleared (e.g. after updating a table of contents). OO
saves the changed picture in the .odt file -- even if the picture was linked.

This means that:

* If you link a picture and then later change the original picture, when you
re-open the document, OO will not reload the new picture.

* Likewise, even if you link a picture, OO saves the picture in the .odt file,
so the .odt file is made larger.

* You cannot see what effects you've applied to a picture.

* To undo any changes to a picture, you need to delete the picture from the
document and reload it.

Please also refer to
http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=15240

Tested on OpenOffice Writer 3.0.1 on both Windows Vista and Ubuntu Hardy.

To reproduce, first example:
----------------------------

1. Insert -> Picture -> From File... -> (choose a picture, e.g. a JPEG) -> Link
(tick the box)

2. Make filter changes to the picture, e.g. from the Picture toolbar, choose
Filter -> Sharpen.

At this point, you can undo. However...

3. Save.

4. Close the document.

If you open the document as a ZIP file, you'll notice that the changed picture
is saved, i.e. not the original picture.

5. Open the document.

There is no way to tell what filter tools you've used, nor can you undo the filters.

6. Close the document.

7. Change the original picture.

8. Open the document.

You'll notice that OO has not reloaded the new picture, but still shows the old
picture.

To reproduce, second example:
-----------------------------

Identical to the first example, except do not link, as follows:

1. Insert -> Picture -> From File... -> (choose a picture) -> Link (do *not*
tick the box)

Steps 2-5 are the same as for the first example.

Steps 6-8 are not relevant.

What would be more useful:
--------------------------

It would be more useful to store the original picture (if not linked) or to
never store the picture (if linked) in the .odt file, and instead store what
needs to be done to the picture.

I realise that this would mean a little extra CPU time every time the document
was opened, but with today's computers, it's no more than a fraction of a second.

At a minimum, allow the user to 'reset' the picture to its default.

Preferably, also allow the user to see what filter tools have been applied
already and to change those tools (e.g. change the sharpen and soften tools to
show a number, e.g. positive for sharpen and negative for soften).

The original picture is always being worked on, so there will be no loss of
quality even if the user frequently changes his mind.

Advantages
----------

1. For a linked picture, OO will always load the latest version and apply the
chosen filters.

2. For a linked picture, OO will not store the picture, allowing the .odt file
to remain small.

Drag the line far away from the original position, and then drag
it slowly approaching the original one, which is still visible.
The line that is being moved snaps to its original one as if it was
still there, while effectively it is being moved.
This means that if you want to move the line some pixels away, you
cannot drag it.
The expected behavior of snapping should exclude the object being moved
from the picture so that it does not attract shapes when dragged.
Besides that, there should be a way to disable snapping to objects

"I try to give the first row in a table, a lower doubleline (and leave the other
lines to single) It seems impossible. I can only apply doublelines to the
complete row. Trying to do this, I noticed lots of bugs in this functionality.

Selecting a linestyle, immediately sets all lines of selected row to that style.
Whereas in Word, the linestyle is only set after selecting which of the lines
should be set (by selecting which borders).

Selecting the lines (borders) to set in Writer, works very randomly. Selecting
complete border, does not apply upper border most of the times. Unselecting
vertical inner lines, works (sometimes), but unselecting horizontal inner lines,
does not work. Most of the times selecting borders, does not change anything.

The only thing selecting borders seems capable of (again: sometimes), is making
certain lines invisible. If that is the purpose of setting the border, than the
possibilities and usability are very limited.

I suggest to copy the functionality as it is implemented in Word, or even better
how it works in WordPerfect, where one can set a linestyle immediately to a
certain part of the border.","ENHANCEMENT"
"This feature is to help facilitate the use of Openoffice.org in creating
documents for use by the US government and its contractors. US government
documents use a specific page numbering scheme:

table of contents:     i, ii, iii...
body:                  1, 2, 3...
appendix:              A-1, A-2, A-3...
attachment:            1-1, 1-2, 1-3...

OO.o Writer supports the TOC and body numbering, but fails when it comes to
creating appendix and attachment page numbers automatically. The request is to
allow page numbers to include text before and after the number similar to
Outline numbering used for paragraph numbers in headers. A table of contents
would then include the page number in the format of A-1, for example instead of
being limited to just the number token such as would occur if a person manually
typed the 'A-' before the page number field in a footer, for example. This
capability is available on Broadvision Interleaf and Quicksilver, but few other
word processors. This would allow Writer to replace the above word processors
and others used heavily for creating government documents.","ENHANCEMENT"

"Note: It severely limits the functionality of universal OpenOffice XForms with
this capability missing.  Here is the history of this defect along with
screenshots http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=14874

Details: The mailto: submission capability within an OpenOffice.org XForm does
not work as it claims.

What I have done:
* Ensured I am supposed to be able to do this by reading documentation. The
official xforms information at http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xforms-20 ...
ice11.html says '. . . bindings, in particular to the URI scheme 'mailto:' may .
. . be supported' and confirm that OO.o DOES support it by reading at
http://www.idealliance.org/proceedings/ ... deadb.html that '. . . [you are able
to send] the instance data . . . as a mail attachment . . .'
* Using a normal form (not an xform) document I was able to use the mailto
feature and it worked correctly.
* Ensured my OO.o configuration settings are correct in Tools | Options |
Internet | Email | Email Program is valid

Rational: Because we can not e-mail the instance data, we are left with storing
instance data to disk or server.  If we choose to disk, then the entire intent
in using the XForm is null as it is no longer portable between operating systems
because their file system nomenclatures are different.  Windows uses C:\... and
Unix variants use /....  If we choose to server, then we are required to setup a
server with its resources (hardware, time, efforts, man power, etc.)

Steps to reproduce:
Open a new XForm
     File
     New
     XML Form Document
Ensure form control toolbar is enabled:
     View
     Toolbars
     Form controls
Ensure form design toolbar is enabled:

     Action: mailto:name@example.com
     Method: Post
     Binding Expression:
     Binding:
     Replace: Instance

     Note that the Action and Method settings are the relevant settings to
making OpenOffice.org supposedly work.  The other settings are relevant to what
the author wants to do.","DEFECT"
"Details: When working with XForms documents, all but one of the the File | Send
options fails with generic error message 'An error occured in sending the
message.  Possible errors could be a missin g user account or a defective setup.

the four possibilities in File | Send the only one that works is 'Document as Email'

What I have done: Confirmed my e-mail settings are correct and successfully sent
from a 'normal' ODT document.  What I mean by 'normal' is a non XML document.

"Details: The XForms option from within the bindings, submission, or instance
tabs to insert a control into the form doesn't work.  When the user selects to
insert the control, nothing happens.

Rational: Currently, the user can select the instance tab and click and drag the
nodes from this tab into the form, but that is undocumented.  Currently, after
selecting the node in the XML data navigator and right-clicking on the node you
are offered an option to 'Insert Control.'  This option does nothing.  One would
think it would insert that node into the document form.

Notes: What would be nice is that if a quick wizard comes up when they select
'Insert Control' to help the user choose various options before OO.o inserts the
form control into the document form.  Examples of various options include the
type of control to insert (some of it could be based off any possible data types
specified in the XML data type settings) such as check box, text box, formatted
field, option button, etc.

"Hello There,

I am using a Swiss French or a French keyboard on my iMac. I am designing a
simple form in Writer. When I chose the 'Multiline with formating' type of
field, I am unable to enter any accented character (like Ã©Ã Ã¨ etc). The 'Dead
keys' don't work, so I cannot get to the Â¨ ^ etc characters. When a 'normal'
character is on the Upcased-key or one such key, like !?, it does not appear too.
This problem seems occuring only under OSX. Laurent Godard checked it on its

I presume this has something to do with the fact that the dot is used as

If column_header was column.header, OOo would probably look for a column header

The result is that the column isn't found in the data source

filename.sheet.1.column_header works, although the sheet name contains a dot, so
this issue seems to affect only column headers/field names containing a '.'
character (in the tests I've made, always at the end of the column header name,

The problem can be reproduced by using attached document 'searchreplace.sxw' and
try to replace the leading '2' in all terms as '25M1' '22B9T' and so on

Steps to reproduce

0. open document
1. select (with mouse) complete text
2. mouseclick on 'search and Replace' - button
3. mark checkbox 'Current selection only
4. Enter '2' into 'Search for'
5. Enter '3' into 'Replace with'
6. click 'Find'  ('2' in headline will be marked)
7. click 'Find' again (because you do not want to replace this '2', 
   but another one)
   expected: '2' of '32S2PF' should be marked
   actual: '2' in headline will remain marked

The problem seems to be, that after step 6 we have a 'new actual selection' for
['2' in headline]

It is no problem to replace the leading '2' step by step with disabled checkbox.

pressing the DEL key results in, i.e. CTRL-A sets it to delete only the content

as it does not delete the table but a line plus a table.

Suggestion: First, selecting a table always selects everything, content plus
structure. This can be done by CTRl+A or clicking at a corner of the table

"To Whom It May Concern:

I work for a BPO that does medical transcription where we use an application
called Instant Text to help our transcriptionists enhance the speed of their
work. You can get details of this application from
http://fitaly.com/new/version5.htm. However, I will give a brief overview here.

Instant Text (IT) is a word and phrase expander software like 'Fast Forward' and
'Smartype' that can be linked to any active application on the desktop.  It is
used by medical transcriptionists (MT) to save time on keying in redundant words
and phrases that occur in medical reports.  For example, the text string 'The
patient is a well-developed and well-nourished' occurs in almost every
dictation, and an MT who uses IT just has to key in the initial letter of each
word and then press the phrase expander to get the whole string in the desired
format i.e., in the example above, 7 keystrokes instead of 49.  The latest
version of IT has an additional feature called command coding where the user can
execute keyboard shortcuts via IT.

Now, let me come to the issue.
1.  When IT links, it gets linked to the entire OOo suite and not individual
applications like Writer or Calc, whereas when used with MS Office, there is the
flexibility of linking IT to either MS Word or MS Excel or MS Powerpoint alone
as appropriate.
2.  IT cannot be used with files opened as 'Read Only' because the moment a key
is pressed a message pops up that says 'Document opened in read-only mode.' 
This plays havoc with keyboard command execution via IT.  It would be great if,
in this regard, MS Excel behavior can be copied to Calc where the user is
allowed to modify the read-only document but the modified document can be saved
only as a separate file.

I hope I am clear on this.

Thank you,
Aji","ENHANCEMENT"

However, I do not suceed the desired result if the numbering goes beyond digit

    bla bla bla blabber

2.  bla bla bla bla bla

10. bla bla bla bla bla

numbering from the rest (in Word, it works that way).

Of course the paragraph would have to be indented that way with an indentation 
but with the first line with the same amount outdented the same amount (in 
German, this would be called 'hÃ¤ngender Einzug'). If one sets such a format, a 
left tab should be automatically set to the position of the indentation such 
that it can readily be used when formating numbered paragraphs.

The ability to enter control characters would also be very beneficial for 
Search and Replace, e.g. if one wants to search for paragraph control charcters 
and replace them, e.g. a paraagraph mark by a forced linefeed.

To represent such characters, I would suggest to use the usual notation e.g.

"If you create a master text document, and include into it one or more
sub-documents that are sourced from a WebDAV server over a URL (attempted both
http:// and vnd.sun.star.webdav:// links), the sub-document will be imported
correctly. However the Navigator side-window will not allow you to double-click
on the sub-document, nor click the 'Edit' button, to access a read/write version
of the sub-document. Double-clicking or clicking the 'Edit' toolbar button does
nothing at all while the URL-linked sub-document is selected.

This problem does not exist if the sub-document is linked in via a file path
(z:\...) to the same WebDAV server (NetDrive providing the linkage.) If both URL
and path-linked files are included, only the path-linked sub-documents can be
opened for editing. It happens regardless of whether or not the WebDAV server is
secured. There are no errors reported, and server logs indicate OpenOffice.org
is not even attempting to contact it -- it's not because the server is throwing
any errors. These same sub-documents can be opened and saved properly if using
File->Open... and pasting in the same URL used to link the document into the
master document. It does not matter whether the master document was pulled from
the WebDAV server or not; the URL's given to it were absolute, and it did
succeed in loading them the first time (for inclusion.)

The problem only seems to be with the Navigator UI refusing to open the
sub-documents when double-clicking/'Edit'-clicking. If that worked, I think the
rest would work as well. (This is not a request for the ability to edit
sub-documents directly from inside the master document without opening them into
their own editor window -- while that would be helpful, it's not a current
feature even with local files, so I'm not asking.)

Support thread:

http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=17491&sid=4524bf0528d98bb289d6120826c791aa&p=80535#p80535

(Side-note, possibly a separate bug: 'update selection' on URL-linked WebDAV
sub-document fails, colors sub-document entry in red, removes text from master
document. Re-inserting the document, with the exact same URL, works just fine.
Opening the master document the first time works fine too.)

"Directly copying from the OOo Trinity Forum:

As anybody maybe knows, a lot of physical, mathematical, algebrical and other
abstract stuff are linked to strange words and signs ( expecially mutuated from

E.g. if you need to write 4-5 different types of characters, every time for any

simply mad and bored!

"The RTF export incorrectly prefixes the \cs control word with the \* control 
symbol in body text. This can make RTF files exported from OpenOffice 
unreadable for older RTF reading software.

The RTF specification version 1.9.1 states: 'inside the style sheet [...] \csN 
must be prefixed with \* and must appear as the first item inside a group. 
Doing so ensures that readers that do not understand character styles will skip 
the character style information correctly. When used in body text to indicate 
that a character style was applied, do not include the \* prefix.'

OpenOffice always includes the \* prefix, even in body text. This can cause 
older RTF software to ignore such text that was prefixed with \*\cs. (This is 
not a bug in those readers. According to the RTF specification \* 'identifies 
destinations whose related text should be ignored if the RTF reader does not

"I know this has been discussed before by user foobard, but on discovering this
problem this morning for the first time, as a professional writer, I'm very
upset that OpenOffice.org 3.0.1 counts words differently than MS Word, and the
radical difference doesn't seem to have been fixed at least as of OOo 3.0.1.
Perhaps this problem has been fixed with the current release, but I haven't
installed the current release yet because, near the end of a project, I'm wary
of doing any tinkering with my computer.

I wrote a rather long, several hundred page project, with a set word limit.
Luckily, OOo word count is lower than Word, or I'd be in a real panic this
morning. But as it is, OOo's word count is about 10,000 words less than Word's
word count. Until this morning, I never even thought that OOo would count words
differently than Word. As a non-programmer, I just figured a word was a word was
a word.

As a professional writer, having an accurate word count is important. If OOo
counts words differently than MS Word, that's fine with me. But I'd like to know
the exact criteria that OOo uses to count words, so that I can at least tell my
editor the criteria that has been used to count words. I cannot find any
documentation anywhere on the OOo website that describes the criteria used to
count words in writer.

For me and other professional writers, having an accurate word count that
matches as closely as possible the industry standard (which unfortunately is MS
Word) is very important and is a P1 issue. At the very least, we need to know
what standard is used specifically, in non-technical terms, so that we can
explain it to an editor. Otherwise, this issue is an app killer for us and I
won't be able to use OOo again even though I love it so much more than Word.

I would attach files as examples, but I am not allowed. As an example, I have
discovered that Word 2007 counts things like 975-976 as one word, while OOo
3.0.1 counts it as two words. Furthermore, I am using endnotes, page numbering,

using getAnchor() of each XTable. I put the anchors for compairing to a
XTextRangeCompare object using compareRegionStarts() and that throws an
IllegalArgumentException.

Ive checked out the XTextRange object by getAnchor(). Most members are set to
null, just object members are not. But the members of that objects are null
again. So the XTextRange I ve got is invalid in my eyes.

"I looked for booklet in issues and found issue #5217 and issue #10796, both
of which are resolved as WORKSFORME.  Both of these issues describe the desire
for booklet printing and both explain how to go about getting.  However, the
solution is to get booklet format by shrinking the page down from 8.5 x 11 in
portrait mode to something that fits on half a 8.5x11 page in Landscape.

Although I was excited to see that I can create a booklet, there are several
usability problems.  The obvious one is that it isn't easy to find.  Searching
for booklet in help yields nothing.  After finding the above two issues, I found
that the print option is brochure.  Although the functionality seems very
similar, I tend to think of brochures as 1 sheet of paper, whereas a booklet can
be multiple sheets.  I think that the difference is important in terms of the
enhancement I am requesting.

The second usability problem is the user can't see what the output will look
like until it is printed because the solution is to shrink the print so that it
will fit.  Print Preview does not even show what the pages will look like
because the functionality is not applied until it is being sent to the printer.
 Therefore, the user must create the page using enlarged graphics and font
sizes, print in brochure mode (remembering to change the print settings to
Landscape) and then look at the output before they know whether or not the
brochure/booklet is viewable.  Changing the page size using the format menu
option doesn't work because it doesn't stop the print functionality from shrinking.

The enhancement, then is to make creating a booklet/brochure part of the
formatting prior to printing.  For a booklet, the page dimensions should be
changed so that it fits on half a page, but while editing, the document flows
from page to page as it does today.  The print mechanism would automatically
order and print the 'half' pages so that the pages can be arranged and folded
into a book.  However, a brochure would be easier to visualize if there were two
pages with columns set up where the text flowed from one column to another
column in the order that makes sense for the brochure.  When I have created
brochures in the past using open office, I have simply set up text frames in the
columns where I wanted the information to be.

My kids have had to create mini books for school projects and, not knowing about
the brochure setting, it has been really painful to try and get the pages to
layout the way that I wanted.  Having only played with the brochure setting, I
can see where although the setup would be easier, usability could still be improved.","ENHANCEMENT"

"The Autoformat feature for tables in Writer is cute and I use it often (because
the Writer tables don't recognize if you insert a new row and the following rows
won't be recolored). But most times I don't need a sum row.

The problem now is that you can not configure the Autoformat feature not to
insert a 'sum row' color in the last row of the table. In a table with e.g. 6
rows (1 header row, 5 content rows) the last 2 rows get the same color but I
don't want this.

Now:

- - - -
Header row
- - - -
bright row
- - - -
dark row
- - - -
bright row
- - - -
dark row
- - - -
DARK row

Header row
- - - -
bright row
- - - -
dark row
- - - -
bright row
- - - -
dark row

It should be possible
* to save a table color sheme without a sum (or/and header) row in Autoformat and
* to assign a table color sheme to an existing table without a sum (or/and

"Some time ago you resolved issue 55595 so that when a mailmerge is done, the
page number/page count is done per record, not for the entire document.

Although this is great for printing bulk letters (each letter has its own
numbering), it makes impossible to use page number/page count for other usages,
such as editing catalogs.

Say I have a list of 500 articles, and I want to create a liste of them, 10
articles per page. I can use mailmerge for that, and I get a nice 50-page
document. Now if I want to work with colleagues on that list, I definitely will
need a consistant page numbering (1/50, 2/50...50/50). But mailmerge cannot do that.

So I suggest that the service MailMerge would be enhanced with an additional
property (let's call it GlobalNumbering for now), that would default to False.
When set to True, it disables the tricks introduced by issue 55595 (1 page style
per iteration of the source document, if I'm not mistaking), and maybe it skips
the insertion of empty pages (if necessary for a valid page count).

On the UI side, well let's say that the mailing assistant was written from a
send-many-letters point of view, so it's not very well adapted for the case I
describe here. One could start with a checkbox option somewhere, keeping in mind
that a rewriting of that assistant could be a good idea (okay I don't like the
mailing assistant, but please note how carefully I try not no start a flamewar).","ENHANCEMENT"

hello there!

I would like to rescale 'pictures' in my document.

To do so requires a whole host of keyboard shortcuts or mouse clicks (as far as
my oo abilities go...)

My document is rather large, and I dread the fact of having to rescale
_manually_ a zillion graphics / pictures that way.

Hence, what I'm looking for is a bit of automation (I hope I can avoid using
'macros' for this though).

Either, is there a way to set global 'scale' settings for 'pictures',
or is there a way of copy & paste of the scale (say, 70 %) from one graphic to
the next (which would still be a lot quicker) ?

I tried 'create a new style from selection' when a graphic is selected and in
'Styles and Formatting' > 'Frame Styles' > 'Graphics' is highlighted.

What is not there is 'Pictures' with the 'scale' option... :(

Any ideas most welcome,

A similar thing happens when inserting a drawing with OLE, issue 103336.  To illustrate the matter, I attached two documents 'original.odt' and 'inserted.odt', the former got inserted into the latter. The abbreviated contents of the content.xml files of the attached documents are shown here:  A paragraph/page of the original file:  CODELINE   Note that the grouping is preserved and the order of appearance and the z-axis ordering of objects within a draw group are preserved, when importing a document, no draw:z-index properties will be added if none are present, objects will be rendered in order of appearance.  There are two more attachments: z-index.odt, it is similar to original.odt but all draw objects now have a draw:z-index property and the order of appearance of the objects in the content.xml file was mixed up. This document was then inserted into another odt document, z-index-inserted.odt, the order in which objects are rendered is the same for both z-index.odt and z-index-inserted.odt. If you unzip the latter then, in content.xml you will see that the objects within a draw group are now sorted according to the z-index number and the draw:z-index property has been stripped of.  Why does this z-index stuff matter?  If the issue of the lost picture gets fixed that would offer developers of ODF producing applications a workaround for the z-axis ordering problem, issue 62094, issue 95948, issue 103338 and perhaps issue 77355, all developers would need to do is to group the drawing objects! The same would hold true for users of OpenOffice if (in Writer) they could select multiple drawing objects and group them.  Why does this missing picture issue matter? You can copy and paste a drawing from 'Draw' to 'Writer' or you could insert it as an OLE object.  Yes that may work, for single page documents but, not for multi page documents, not if you wish to append a large number of (automatically generated) pages as an appendix to a report.

However, if you thus create an odt document and insert that into another odt document the picture is missing again.  if anyone knows of a better workaround, changes to the xml code, that would be much appreciated.

Every now and then (unpredictably) the window will jump to the position of the

first selected form element. This normally happens when the tab button is hit.
So that you end up with the window showing page 1 but the cursor is now in a

the window to flick down to the location of the newly selected form element and

OO/WordPad (in other words, using the clipboard to transfer data).

1. Start OpenOffice 3.1
2. Select the 'Insert/Special Character...' menu/submenu.  The 'Special
Characters' dialog will open.
3. Select 'Symbol' from the 'Font' drop down.
4. Scroll down and then click on the U+F0B7 bullet symbol (10 rows down, 8th
column over).
5. Select the OK button on the 'Special Characters' dialog.  The bullet looking
character will be typed into the OpenOffice document by OpenOffice.
6. Back at the document, Highlight the bullet character, and either press Ctrl+C
or menu option 'Edit/Copy'.
7. Back in Windows, start WordPad (for Windows XP its START/All
Programs/Accessories/WordPad).
8. In WordPad, either press Ctrl-P or menu option 'Edit/Paste'.
9. You should see that a Wingdings/12/Symbol character has been pasted in.  The
actual character looks like a clock showing 1pm.  This is the wrong character.
10. Highlight the character in WordPad, then from the 'Font' drop down, select
the 'Symbol' font.
11. You should now see the same character formatting representation that was
originally entered in the OpenOffice document.

If, instead of doing steps 6-11, you do a 'File/Save As...' from OpenOffice, and
select a file type of 'Rich Text Format (.rtf)', and save the document, then
reopen the saved document in WordPad, you will see that the symbol being
displayed is the incorrect Wingdings symbol of a clock at 1pm.  If you instead
open the same previously saved rtf document in OpenOffice 3.1, you will see the
character is formatted as a Times New Roman 12 character.","DEFECT"
"Professional/creative writers are turning to feature-poor editors because they
offer what the big boys don't - a Spartan GUI with only the displayed text and

a) a submode of the fullscreen mode or

Situation:
Entering text with font Tahoma or Chandas, IME is chandas IME (links below)

Summary of problem:
Font size 14:
On enabling Chandas IME and pressing key 'a' continuously to span over to end of
line results in badly placed cursor, offset into the character instead of end of
char.

Typing similarly over to a part of next line and moving back the cursor to the
end of 1st line (through back arrow) skips last char on the 1st line. However
cursor moves to the last char on pressing 'end' key or mouse click.

The situation is accentuated with with BOLD font. 
While typing, stopping 1 or 2 chars short of the end of line, the text at the
end of line is not rendered completely. Instead, scrolling up and down the page
out of and into view will make invisible characters to reappear.
Now even the cursor cannot position cursor at end of line. Selection with double
click on the line omits the last 2 chars. Further typing at end of line results
in 2 chars spilling over the right margin.

The behavior is perfectly repeatable.

Happens whether 'enabled for CTL' and 'enabled for asian languages' are enabled
or disabled.

"Sorry, the description to reproduce this problem is a bit lengthy because I
can't just attach an example document since the problem lies exactly in the fact
that the document behaves differently after having been saved and loaded again.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open a new writer document
2. Enter the text 'abcdef'
3. Select 'abc' and insert a new bookmark on the selection (using
Insert->Bookmark), name the bookmark 'bookmark1'
4. Select 'def' and insert a new bookmark on the selection (using
Insert->Bookmark), name the bookmark 'bookmark2'
5. Open the navigator (F5) and in it click on 'bookmark1'. The text 'abc' should
now be selected.
6. Hit the Del-Key thus deleting 'abc' (but not bookmark1)
7. Save the document (but don't close the document or reload it!)

Now execute the following macro which changes the contents of bookmark1 to 'xyz':

Sub Main
  bookmark1 = ThisComponent.getBookmarks().getByName('bookmark1')
  bookmark1.getAnchor().setString('xyz')
End Sub

The document now contains the text 'xyzdef'. 'xyz' is inside of bookmark1, 'def'
is inside of bookmark2. This is the expected behaviour.

Now (without saving) close the document and open it again (or just use
File->Reload).
Execute the same macro as above. Since the document should be in the same state
as above the results should be the same, right? Well, no. After executing the
macro the document now only contains the text 'xyz' which now lies inside of
bookmark1 as well as bookmark2. 'def' was deleted.


The problem seems to be (described in pseudo-XML) that after step 7 the state of
the bookmarks is:
<bookmark1></bookmark1><bookmark2>def</bookmark2>
But after reloading the document the state is:
<bookmark2><bookmark1>def</bookmark2></bookmark1>","DEFECT"

"Outline-oriented operations in OOo can be improved in a number of ways:

 * Separate the objects-view and the headings-view into separate
   GUI panes, to pave the way for more sophisticated outlining.

 * Use a proper tree control to display headings in the Navigator
    --allow selection of multiple headings to promote/demote
    --allow collapse/expand of individual headings, as
      well as global collapse/expand 

 * Do outlining operations in a variation on the main window, and
   allow text to be displayed or hidden when the heading is visible.

 * If other styles are defined with numbers that correspond to 
   the heading levels (e.g. Text body 1, Text body 2, etc.) then
   apply Navigator promote/demote operations to those paragraph styles,
   as well as to headings.

 * When dragging headings in the template, take all subheadings
   with the heading instead of leaving them behind. (If moving a
   chapter heading in a navigator view where I can't even see the
   text that's under it, what are the odds that I want to move
   the whole chapter? As opposed to placing the chapter heading in 
   front of some text I can't even see?)

 * Allow selection and copying of multiple entries in the Navigator
   view (without subtext, or optionally with).

 * Add an option to show level numbers in the Navigator, even if

results were disjoint, instead.)

When resizing an image by the corner handles, the image should be resized

When resizing an image by the middle handles, the image should be stretched /

The expected behaviour is the behaviour MS Office has.  I consider the current

- Now create a new text document, or open an existing one

saving, a lot of bitmap images in it.)

Variant: In the first occasion (which I could not reproduce) OO did issue an
error message (General I/O Error...). But after issuing this message it would

"Presently:

(1) Doubleclicking a word with the mouse selects only the alphanumeric
characters in the word itself (no whitespace or punctuation). 

(2) If a user selects a word using doubleclick, then cuts (Ctrl-X or Scissors
icon), OOo also cuts exactly 1 (unselected) space to the LEFT of the selected
text, provided at least 1 space exists. 

(3) If a user selects a word using doubleclick, then presses the backspace
(delete) key on the keyboard, OOo deletes (not cuts) the selected characters
only, leaving any spaces to the left and right. 

(4) Tripleclicking selects a full line (not paragraph) of text. 


Proposed changes to the UI:

(1) Doubleclicking a word with the mouse would select the alphanumeric
characters within that word, along with any space characters that follow.
Preferably, this would be language-dependent. For languages that read left to
right (such as English), spaces to the right of the word would be selected; for
languages that read right to left, spaces to the left would be selected. 

(2) Cut (Ctrl-X or Scissors icon) would only cut those characters that were
selected (highlighted). 

(3) Ideally, the effect of Doubleclick and Tripleclick would be customizable.
The default actions would be: Doubleclick = select word (alphanumeric
characters) plus any spaces that follow. Tripleclick = select paragraph (rather
than line).


Advantages of the proposed changes:

(1) The behavior of Cut would be more intuitive. Normally, the user expects only
highlighted (selected) text to be cut. If a space is also to be cut, then it
makes sense to highlight that space upon selection.

(2) Cut and Paste would be more reciprocal. If the user doubleclicks a word,
then cuts (Ctrl-X), then pastes (Ctrl-V), without moving the cursor between the
operations, the result is to get back where one started. However, when one tries
this in OOo at present, these result is that one space is lost. For example,
doubleclick 'sample' in the sentence: 'This is a sample sentence.' Cut, then
paste, without moving the cursor. Result: 'This is asample sentence.' 

(3) Mousing behavior would be more consistent with keyboard behavior. At
present, Ctrl-Shift-LeftArrow and Ctrl-Shift-RightArrow select the alphanumeric
characters of the word and any spaces to the right. The proposed change would
make doubleclick more compatible with this behavior. 

(4) While selecting lines of text is sometimes useful in programming, in word
processing it is rare that the user would want to do this. Typically, it would
make more sense for the user to select a sentence or paragraph. The simplest,
most useful function of a tripleclick would be to select the current paragraph.
(In an ideal world, tripleclick would select a sentence and quadclick a
paragraph. However, automatically determining the start and end of a sentence is
a nontrivial task.) 

(5) The overall UI behavior would be more like that of MS Word. Since many OOo
users are accustomed to using MS Word, this is also a decided plus.

would be advantageous. Thanks!","ENHANCEMENT"

"This issue is about word wrapping for Korean language. I am not sure whether 
this issue should be in |10n or here; however, I think the issue I am filing on 
is more appropriate here since it is about word wrapping.

I just installed 1.1 RC3. In this version, it seems word wrapping for Korean 
language are still occuring. Word wrapping for English, French, German and 
Spanish works fine as I tested it. If a word is not completed at the end of 
line, then it should be wrapped in the next line. But in 1.1rc3, it still 
treats each character as single word and does not wrap them at all. I searched 
help file and it only explains it as a matter of hyphenation. I also posted 
this problem in user mailing list and many responded that it's a hyphenation 
problem, too.  I tried all different hyphenation options and it is still 
occuring.

FYI, in Chinese and Japanese, word wrapping is not important, since each 
character could work as one single word or sentence. In contrast, Korean 
language works like any other Western langueges in the sense of word wrapping. 
Each vowel and consonant make one character and one or more charaters 
constitute one word. If word wrapping is based on the empty space between 
characters or words, then it could be resolved this problem easily, I guess.

In vim, if I set format options as :set fo=twa, then I can use vim as any fine 
wordprocessor in the sense of word wrapping. It wraps any uncompleted word of 
any languages at the end of line and displays in the next new line. I want this 
simple and essential features in OOo for Korean language, too.

"First of all I want to state how frustrating it is to even get to this point of
reporting a bug. No wonder MS Office is on most desktops. And I have reported
this bug before and no one gave a coherent answer. Again, KUDOS to MS. Their
software at least works when you NEED it to work.

Now, I am reporting a really bad bug that has NEVER been sorted out and it such
a stupid bug that it really is annoying.

When doling mail merges, I want to have the salutation as follows:

Dear William,


Now, the mail merge wizard does NOT ALLOW ONE TO DO THIS.

It supposedly has the ability when you look at the options but IT DOES NOT WORK.
It has the options of Dear 1, (whatever that is), Dear Mrs. <LastName>,
<FirstName>, [ Dear 1, <FirstName>, ], Dear , Dear 1, .

When trying to customize the salutiation all the options one gets is this:

Dear Mrs. <2>,
Ms. <2>,
Dear <1>,
Hello <1>,

What do the numbers relate to? Nothing.

One cannot actually make a NEW salutation from scratch. I HAVE TRIED IT. It
works in its own way, but garbage comes out. Really stupid.

Whoever created this got too involved in the details and came up with something
so assinine that the bloody thing does not work the way it should.

The options that should be available should be based on whether one checked the
gender box. If one is not checked ALL cannot be checked.

If gender box is used:

Dear Sir,
Dear Madam,
Dear Mr. <LastName>,
Dear Ms. <LastName>,
Dear Mrs. <LastName>,
<FirstName>,
<FirstName> <LastName>,
Hello <FirstName>,
Hello <FirstName> <LastName>,
Customized to WHATEVER THE USER WANTS.

If gender is not used:

Dear <FirstName>,
Dear <FirstName> <LastName>,
Hello <FirstName>,
Hello <FirstName> <LastName>,

could use a simple tool to seek out special characters like end-of-line, tab,

"PROBLEM: In order for the caption to move around with the image (if one decides
to move the image to another location in the document) one has to be very
careful to select the frame that contains the caption and image.  Intuitively,
one would select the image and move it to the new location, but this causes
strange and unexpected behavior when a caption is involved (the caption doesn't
move with the image).

HISTORY: My wife was trying to arrange a bunch of images on a page with
captions.  When she tried to move the images around on the page, the captions
did not follow.  It took about 45 minutes for me to finally discover that one
needs to be very careful about selecting the caption box/frame (and not the
image) in order to move the image (with associated caption) within the document.

I'm requesting that this behavior be changed.  Possibly make captions behave
similar to layers in that they can be locked to or grouped with the image by
default.  Perhaps when the image is inserted, it is automatically grouped with a
blank caption.  When the users types in caption information then a border
becomes visible around the image and caption and expands as the sentence gets
longer.","ENHANCEMENT"

"OpenOffice has always required that Form Letter (1.0) / Mail Merge (1.1)
requires that a Data Source is configured in the user's profile. Users
converting from Microsoft Office find this baffling, as MS Word allows
information on the source of mail merge data to be included in the Word document.

In addition, if a document that contains Mail Merge fields is shared with
another user (either in place or by email etc), it requires that user to also
configure a Data Source with the same name (and to work out what that name
should be, by using the Show Fields option).

Therefore lets find a way to make the Mail Merge data source information travel
with the document. It would be preferred if the Mail Merge data source could
still be modified using 1.1's Exchange Database feature.

PROPOSALS:

USER-DEFINED AND DOCUMENT-DEFINED DATA SOURCES:
Create a generic ability to define Data Sources in the document (as opposed to
in the user profile) so that Data Sources are either user-defined (referring to
defined in the user's OOo profile) or document-defined. The feature could then
be used for purposes in addition to Mail Merge. The 'Data Sources' pane would be
updated to indicate which Data Sources are user-defined and which are
document-defined - either by indicating with a different icon, or by making user
data sources and data sources parent to the data sources in the Explorer tree.

MAIL MERGE UI
Provided that 'document-defined data sources' is implemented above, the Mail
Merge UI in 1.1 could largely go unmodified, although it may be beneficial to
emphasise the use of document-defined data sources, or make it the default
(perhaps even make it an Options preference?).

I'm new to proposing enhancements. What else can I do (as a non-programmer) to
help this along? Feel welcome to make your own proposals on how this could be
tackled.","ENHANCEMENT"

1. Does not add spacing to the top of the first page (c.1: special case)

b) put at the top of a page after an explicit page break only in 'don't use

"My laptop (Lenovo T61 wide screen) hard drive died a month or so ago. It was
replaced under warranty from Lenovo, along with the Window OS, but I've been
gradually restoring my apps and files. I discovered that I don't have the
MSOffice apps, so I installed OpenOffice 3 and have been beginning to use it.

I was just using it to write a letter. To my shock, a word I was starting to
type was autocompleted with one of my passwords. Navigating through the OO help,
I discovered an autocomplete list that included dozens of passwords, along with
many URLs I've accessed, login IDs, and other stuff. That function area also
included a 'collect words' box, apparently checked by default, which I
unchecked. I also deleted all the passwords from the list and turned off all the
autocorrection I could find.

That's bad enough, but where did OpenOffice get those passwords? Many of them I
haven't used for years, certainly not since installing OO, and all I can think
of is that it found them in some file that I had restored. 

Does OO, on installation, harvest autocompletion vocabulary from files it seeks
out on the machine? I can see doing that for a custom vocabulary list from a
spellchecker or a speech recognition program. These may have been in
autocompletion files from my old browser installations. I never expected them to
show up in a letter. This is dangerous! 

(I have conservatively chosen priority 3, rather than 2. What happens if typists
less attentive than me start sending out passwords in their letters and blog
posts? And I have chosen 'editing' as the subcomponent, but 'open-import' might
be appropriated as well. If so, note that I didn't choose what files to open and
import vocabulary from.)","ENHANCEMENT"

ThisComponent.getTextTables().getByIndex(0).getCellRangeByName('A1:A1')

This behaviour has several unnatural consequenses:
1. the clipboard/transferable-content will not be the same if one tries to work
with it after performing a selection
2. if one works with getSelection() he'll receive a table-cursor if A1:B1 is

"According to the MS RTF specification, each Unicode character in RTF should have its ANSI  equivalent. This is necessary for compatibility with old applications which don't recognize  Unicode RTF. However, in RTF files generated by OOo this ANSI equivalent is always replaced  with a question mark. For example, a word of Russian text may look as follows:    \u1055 ?\u1088 ?\u1086 ?\u1074 ?\u1077 ?\u1088 ?\u1082 ?\u1072 ?  .  This means that any RTF file containing national characters (Cyrillic, Greek, accented Latin...)  can be opened only in a Unicode-aware application. If we open such a file in any other  application (like MS Word 6.0/95, Page Maker, Quark Xpress), all national characters will  be simply lost. So I can't use RTF as a universal interchange format, which was possible with  MS Word.    Really, however, these question marks should be inserted only for characters which have no  equivalent in any windows-125* codepage. If such an equivalent exists (for example, Cyrillic  `a' has code 0xC0 in windows-1251, Greek alpha is 0xC1 in windows-1253 and so on), it  should be used in RTF file. So the Russian word above should look as follows:    \u1055\'cf\u1088\'f0\u1086\'ee\u1074\'e2\u1077\'e5\u1088\'f0\u1082\'ea\u1072\'e0  .

converted to text on opening, with the 'paragraph' breaks following horizontal
lines, not cells, if there were any cells containing multiple lines.  As an

on another line in that cell, and their city and postal code are on a second

- Use the menu 'edit' - 'mark all' to mark the whole text

- use the menu 'extras' - 'sort'

- pick the following (useful) options: 
     key one = TRUE, column = 1, type = alphanum, order = ascending
     other keys = FALSE
     directions = lines
     separator = tab
     language = french  (or german or english, doesn't matter for the bug)
     consider capitals = NO

- now press OK to sort the whole file. What we want is many textlines that are
sorted alphabetically, according to the text before the TAB.

- result: we get a somehow sorted text file. It's difficult to see at the first
glance, what's wrong, because the file is so HUGE. But after careful inspection,
you can see that the result is totally random! :(

For example a properly sorted file should have lines starting with Z at the end
of it. Our result doesn't.

Additionally the sorting procedure results in different results if you just sort
the result of the first sorting again and again. But it does not seem to
converge to a usefully sorted file :(

"Hi All,

    I sent a couple of hour this week with a lady helping her
migrate over to OO.  Her major beef with OO was the way it
handles envelopes.  And she has a point.  So, here are three 
suggestion that I believe would be easy to implement:

First off, before my suggestions: not that there are none, but
I have yet to find an operator that actually wants an envelope
inserted in their document.   There poor soles 'suffer' with
the current method.

1)  In print dialog box, add an additional button on the bottom
left, next to the 'New Doc.' bottom titled 'Print.'  That way,
the operator can just zip out a quick envelope.  This avoids
the wasted time (steps) creating a new envelope document or
trying to figure out how to remove an envelope from an
existing document.  And for those operators that actually
want an envelope in their document, they still have their
'New Doc.' and 'Insert' buttons.   Make everyone happy
and saves a lot of time and steps.

2)  If the operator has highlighted an existing address in their
document before activating the envelope dialog, automatically
paste the highlighted text into the 'Addressee' box.  Big, big
time saver.  Especially for the 'low skills' operator that
doesn't realize they can copy and paste the text or does not know
how to manipulate the clipboard when the 'Edit' pull down
is not activated (those who have not learned to right click or use 
the Ctrl-C & Ctrl-V).  Again, big time saver.

3)  As most of the operators I have dealt with are not
inserting envelopes, it would make a lot more sense
to move the 'envelope' pick from the 'Insert' pull
down to the 'Tools' pull down -- especially if you
implement my above suggestions.  The tools menu
will much more closely reflect the actual use of the
envelope dialog.

"The Stylist currently provides a nice hierarchical view of styles, but only for
all styles (which is a large number of styles). It would be great to be able to
see the hierarchical view of only specific subsets of styles (e.g., applied,
custom, etc.).  For example, I would love to be able to see, hierarchically,
which styles are currently applied in a particular document because they might
be the only ones that I?m interested in at a particular moment.

Philosophically, I think that the Stylist drop-down list (at the bottom of the
Stylist) contains two related but distinct GUI concepts: it contains not only a
?style filtering? concept to limit the styles displayed in the Stylist (applied,
custom, etc.), but also a ?style viewing format? concept to determine how the
filtered styles are to be displayed in the Stylist (i.e., list, tree).  The
concepts are very related, but I feel that they are distinct and should be
separated.  At the moment, both concepts are contained in the one drop-down
list, which makes it inflexible.  If these concepts were separated into their
own distinct GUI controls, the user could choose very flexibly which styles the
Stylist is to display, and, separately and independently, how the Stylist is to
display them (e.g., list, tree).  This flexible filtering and formatting
approach would enable the user to zoom in very quickly on only the styles
currently of interest, and to view them in best way for the job at hand.

Possible approach:

Remove the Hierachical choice from the Stylist drop-down box, and move the
Hierarchical choice to a new on/off toggle button on the Stylist toolbar at the
top (near the Paragraph Styles button, the Character Styles button, etc.).

Optionally (I say optionally because I?m not fully certain about the following
suggestion), change the drop-down list to support new list entries at the end of
the existing list, containing check-box list-entries so that the user can select
not only individual styles categories (as is possible now, e.g., applied,
custom, etc.) but also combinations of categories (e.g., applied plus custom).

I believe that this approach would separate filtering from viewing, and would
provide much more flexibility for the Stylist.","ENHANCEMENT"

1) Enhanced help on the condition syntax of hidden paragraphs,

2) Enhanced syntax of the condition of hidden paragraphs etc. in

   unusual characters in their field names.

EXPLICATORY TEXT:
What to do, when a paragraph should only be shown when a specific field whitin a
database contains some data? The help says: Insert/Field/Other, select the
function tap, then 'hidden paragraph', and enter 'NOT name' as condition, where
'name' is the name of the db-field. Here we are!

Now, what to do, if the 'name' contains some space, as in 'first name'. Then you
have to enter 'NOT [first name]' with brackets. It's a pity that the help of OOo
doesn't mention the brackets.

Second problem: What must I do when the 'name' contains a point, as in
'benutzerdef. 1' in the german sdbc:address:mozilla-driver of OOo1.1rc4? I would
propose something like 'NOT ['benutzerdef. 1']' or 'NOT ['benutzerdef. 1']'. But

In Word, if you have managed to insert a table (not an Excel, just a native one)
, you can place the cursor anywhere in the table, press SHIFT-ALT-UP/DOWN and 
the line you're in moves up or down.
That's an awfully handy feature, helping to reorder a table in as good as no 
time. Perhaps such a goody is already hidden somewhere in OOO. I could not 
figure it out, though.
(You may have noticed that I mentioned just one good thing of Word and did not 
enumerate all the bad ones, which would lead to an Internet-crash... :-).

"We got a a complex case here:

We're using a master document with several subdocuments.

The master document as well as the subdocuments contain several hidden
paragraphs, which are displayed or hidden
by different conditions. The conditions depend on the current selected record of
a database, which is used for the
form printing.

When we now start a form print to file and select 'save as individual documents'
and start the printing on a WindowsXP or Windows 7 machine, the CPU load goes to
100% and nothing happens. Even after a whole day
of waiting the OpenOffice process still consumes 100% load. After investigating
the output directory,
it could be seen that the first file has been created but is empty.

This problem occurs when

using OpenOffice 3.1.1 with WindowsXP on a terminal server
using OpenOffice 3.1.1 with WindowsXP on a single machine
using OpenOffice 3.1.1 with WIndows 7 on a laptop

and is reproducable on every run. With linux machines either remote or local,
this problem does not occur and everything runs fine.","DEFECT"

This bug was originally reported downstream in LaunchPad at

In Find&Replace, a regular expression of '^' (without the quotes) never matches
anything. It should match the front of every line.

For example, if you want to comment out a block of code in the Basic macro
editor, it should be possible to
Find ^ in a selection and replace it with 'rem ' and have 'rem ' inserted at the
front of all the selected lines.
But ^ alone does not work, and never matches any lines.

The use of of ^ alone to match the start of lines (and, similarly $ for
end-of-lines) has been a fundamental feature of regular expressions in computer
systems since they were first widely used in 1970s Unix. OO should not deviate.","DEFECT"

For example, in the sentence 'I love the whole ×‘×¨×™×?×” and then some', when the

which is after the word 'whole'. So the positions of the carets, represented by
the vertical line would be like 'I love the whole |×‘×¨×™×?×”| and then some'.

the user the visual image of what he should be imagining otherwise.","ENHANCEMENT"

OpenOffice.org 3.1.1; OOO310m19 (Build:9420)
[Probably impacts others; I only recently jumped the machine I do my envelope
printing on to this package from an ancient 2.x.]

Issue:

Insert -> Envelope -> Printer -> Setup options do not appear to be persistent,
or at least are not predictably persistent, even within a document or template.
This adds a number of extra steps to envelope printing.


Use case / Steps to reproduce:

Combine this version of OO.o 3.1.1 with a HP LaserJet 3030 driven by recent
HPLIP/hpijs packages.  #10 Envelopes will print correctly based on the centered
positioning option in [Envelope -> Printer] _if_ the Envelope page type in
[Envelope -> Printer -> Setup] is set to Envelope #10.

By default, the Printer -> Setup field is set to 'Letter.'  OO.o will detect
this and attempt to format an envelope-sized frame onto something resembling
appx. two-thirds of a 'Letter'-sized page in landscape, but the printing stack
presumably tries to center this by default (probably desirable for other
programs with odd-sized output) because the bottom ~third of the page is not
present, causing 'none of these choices work' alignment issues.


Desired behavior/resolution:

Envelope page-size setup preferences should persist per printer, and/or the
[Insert -> Envelope -> Help] and [Insert -> Envelope -> Printer -> Help] should
document where this setting is supposed to be stored.

Adding an 'Envelope' tab in [File -> Printer Settings] to set the default
envelope page definition for the Envelope 'wizard' would also appear to make sense.


Related observations:

Saving a properly-formatted Envelope as a document (and presumably as a
template) preserves the page size definition, so this is only a problem with the
'wizard' / ephemeral Insert Envelope feature.  

However,
Insert -> Envelope -> New Document called to create an ephemeral envelope from a
document/template that *does* have an Envelope page style set does not inherit
that Envelope page style... or at least, interprets it from Envelope #10 back
into the 'User' page size definition, the ~2/3s-of-a-Letter-page as described above.","ENHANCEMENT"

"During investigation of issue 105557 it turned out that creating uno References
from SwModify listeners is inherently not thread-safe.

With the unocore locking refactoring work in CWS swunolocking1, the class
SwUnoCallBack was removed, because all it did was allow for this unsafe use of
its registered listeners; SwDoc::pUnoCallBack is now simply a SwModify.

As a consequence, every time a uno object for a ReferenceMark,
DocumentIndexMark, or Footnote is required, a new one will be created.
This is suboptimal: the uno objects for these should register directly at the
corresponding core objects, which should have a weak reference to the uno
object, thus allowing for re-use of existing uno objects in a thread-safe way.

When this is done, SwDoc::pUnoCallBack can be removed completely.","DEFECT"

"Open Office documents can refer to externel resources such as images which are

itsself, but it can compromise the privacy of unaware users. Everytime a

about the act of openeing, the time and IP of a user.

The problem arises because the vast majority of users:
a) Are not aware that this is happening
b) Can not disable this feature.

An easy solution would be to:
a) Inform the user when this is happening
b) Add an option to disable individual or all external requests

The options could be:

- always allow requests (current default setting)
- never allow requests
- always ask (new default), upon a external request inform the user what OOo

3. Change Text Direction to Right-to-left; Options is changed to Right.

"Hello

(Sorry that I couldn't find the best place to suggest this, since it applies to
all OpenOffice Applications. Can someone move it to the correct place, please?)

Today there is the option 'Edit->Compare Document' that helps to merge two
versions of the same document.However it would be extremely helpful it there
could be a mechanism to perform a '3-way diff and merge' of documents triggered
at the command line (ie. soffice.bin -writer base.odf this.odf other.odf).

This feature alone would make it very easy to integrate OOO documents with
major Version Control Systems. Specially the ones like Mercurial, Bazaar, Git,
SVN and CVS.

This simple feature could enable the customization of VCS (and DVCS) tools to
use OpenOffice to performe merging and diffing of all OOO supported files.
Moreover, when a 3-way diff is used it is much easier to detect real changes
(additions and deletions). OOO could even have an option to trigger the merges
automatically whenever there are no conflicts (two people haven't changed the
same unit of work - line, paragraph, whatever).

We could than use OOO documents in a truly revision controlled way!

"as can be seen by other issues (issue 30534 about caption moving, issue 20853 
about deletion and other), caption management can be improved.

i'll try to describe at least first steps to improve caption handling.

1. if caption dialog is open for an object that already has caption, edit 
current caption instead of creating another (are there cases when two captions 
are needed for single object ?). this would allow easy changing caption text, 
cathegory, location without completely re-creating it (and cutting object out of 
frame, pasting it etc).

2. add 'before' and 'after' fields in caption properties (just like in outline 
numbering). for example, in some languages it is common to add letters 'nr' 
(that represent 'number') before the number itself. some languages require a dot 
after numerals. (how fortunate, i need them both ;) ).
this would also be a workaround so that categories containing spaces could be 
imitated. probably these after/before fields should be common for category.
btw, only 'before' should be created anew - 'separator' already acts as 'after'.

3. to resolve issue 20853 i would suggest adding a button 'remove' (similar to 
one in numbering properties) which completely removes caption and frame, so that 
picture is the way it was before adding caption.","ENHANCEMENT"
"_THE ISSUE_

The way OO Writer currently handles graphics objects, in documents, is to load
every single graphic and keep it in memory for the entire duration for which the
document is open.  The impact of this approach is the subject of Issue 102773.

In the case of the aforementioned issue, an 82-page, 11.4 MB .odt document,
containing many graphics objects, is initially opened very quickly (about 3
seconds) and memory usage increase is marginal; but about a second later, Writer
proceeds to load every single graphic in the file, tying up the processor for
over a minute and bringing total memory consumption beyond 417 MB.  I'm on a P3
system.  By comparison, the same document, converted to .doc format and opened
in MS Word, is opened quickly and with much less than 100 MB (began under 40 MB
and peaked around 60 MB when the document was scrolled up and down).  This isn't
a format issue, because when the same .doc version is opened with OO Writer,
over 400 MB of memory is again consumed.  Note: the aforementioned timings do
not include application start times.  In both cases, the applications were first
started then the documents were drag-dropped.

Now imagine if someone was attempting to use OO Writer to produce a 400-page
guide containing many screenshots.  What would OO Writer require then?  I'm
assuming as much as 3 GB.  This is unreasonable.


_REQUESTED SOLUTION_

In my experience, MS Word does not keep all graphics loaded all the time
(correct me if I'm wrong), and I do not see why OO Writer cannot do something
similar.  My request therefore, is that OO Writer take an approach somewhat like
the following (I'm sure there are better approaches; these are just my thoughts):

1. Load all graphics objects for the page in view, obviously;
2. Load all graphics objects for the 10 pages before (if any) and 10 pages after
(if any) the current view;
3. If the cursor is out of view (not on the current page) and is outside the
bounds of the pages in #2, speculatively load graphics objects for the 5 pages
before (if any) and 5 pages after (if any) the page currently with the cursor;
4. If #3 was true and the cursor is then brought into the page in view (e.g. by
clicking the viewed page), short delay unload the graphics objects in #3;
5. If #2 was true then, upon scrolling such that a page is outside the bounds,
lazy unload the graphics objects for the page now out of bounds and immediately
load the graphics objects for the new page(s) in bounds (if any); and
6. An additional factor, such as a memory bounds parameter, could facilitate the
loading of graphics objects from even more pages, so long as the memory bound is
not exceeded.

The above selection of 5 and 10 pages is just for discussion.  Whatever is
optimal would be best and would depend both on OO load/unload performance and
user perception.

All that being said, I can't code or understand code for anything as complex as
OO, so it's entirely up to the OO devs whether my request is even considered.

In office applications two different concepts for form-like functionality exist:
form fields and form controls. The former are real fields that are resized
automatically according to the size of their content, but are bound into the

"Hi!

I hope this is not a duplicate issue.
Here is description of the problem.
I noticed that if the size of a paragraph is relatively large (more than one
page Letter), the a search using regular expressions skips that paragraph. I
mention that I am aware of the fact that there is a limit size of characters in
a paragraph, however the issue is with 'normal' sizes.

Attached it is included a test doc file. It includes 3 paragraphs, with the 2nd
the largest. The point of interest is the quoted text that it is emphasis.

1. Put the cursor at the beginning of the 1st para.
2. Ctrl+f to open the search engine.
3. In the 'search for' field put 
â€œ(.*)â€?
Please copy and paste the above text exactly, since the quotation characters are
different at the beginning and at the end of string. You can look to see the
difference better in the attached file.
The search string should capture all the text in between two quotation marks.
4. Select Regular expressions from More Options expansion.
5. Click once Find button.
The text 
â€œEvidently some ...â€?
should be highlighted.
6. Click Find one more time
Notice that the 2nd para is skipped although it has text in quotes, and only the
text in 3rd para is selected.

Here there are 2 observations.
a) If the 2nd para is broken in 2 almost equal sizes and perform the same
operations as above, the find will identify the text quoted in the 2 para (that
is now in 2 parts).
b) Let's go back at the 3rd para. Notice that the text identified include 2
consecutive sentences that are quoted, i.e. the text FROM â€œThe promises were ...
TO with the promiseâ€?.
This is not normal. It should find the two different sentences, first â€œThe
promises were ...his seedâ€? and after that the following sentence 'â€œWhat I mean
... with the promiseâ€?.

Template' and 'Export Template' from Template Management. As for import and
export, the tasks are achieved more easily via a combination of the normal file
selector and Templates->Edit or Templates->Save.

2. Replace 'Address Book' in Template Management and 'Address Book Source' in
File->Templates with a single menu item under File or Tools.

3. Remove 'Documents' (and selection menu) from Template Management. If a quick
way to list the contents of well known document directories is wanted, the
functionality might be added to the file selector instead (maybe allow the user
to bookmark directories.)

4. Remove 'Documents' from Templates and Documents, too.

5. Merge remaining functionality of Template Management and Templates and
Documents into a single template (only) dialog.

6. Make Templates->Edit... symmetric with Templates->Save..., or simply remove
the item (the template dialog may be used instead.)

7. Consider including entry for (new) template button as well as what else is
left of File->Templates directly under File.

8. Relax the distinction between built-in document types and templates. Allow
addition to File->New of entries for (user) template based document creation,
and perhaps also built-ins to be move do different categories or disabled
completely.

"When you insert a field, there is a Format box where you can choose 'From

if you have numbers like '3,100' and '280,000' formatted with '##0,#' in your 
spreadsheet and you import them into a mail merge, they come out looking 
like '3100' and '280000'.  This can be a real problem, especially when you 
want to do a merge with dollar values ($280000 looks pretty silly).

"When writer saves a file as RTF, some non-ascii characters in metadata (e.g.
author name) are written literally without hex-escaping, in conflict with the
RTF specification and other software expecting all RTF content to be ascii.

For example, if you (having a new empty writer document):
1. Set first/last name in Tools->Options->User Data to Ján ?os;
2. Update document metadata using File->Properties->General->Reset (with 'Apply
user data' checked);
3. Save the file as RTF;

you'll end up with this declaration inside the RTF:
{\info{\upr{\author Ján ?os}{\*\ud{\author J\'e1n \u317\'3fos}}} ...

Note that the U+00E1 A WITH ACUTE ACCENT in \upr is encoded as literal byte
0xe1, not as the proper (and later used) escape sequence \'e1, as required for
all characters beyond 7-bit ascii by the RTF specification.

Same issue applies to other (but not all) characters in the codepage used in the
file. 

For another example, using the name Ján Hraško, in locale sk_SK.UTF-8 and all
language settings set to Slovak, results in a file encoded in codepage 1250,
with relevant code:
{\info{\author Ján Hraško} (converted, the bytes are again 0xe1 and 0x9e, above

"Writer currently justifies text by three different methods depending on the script type (Latin, CJK, CTL). 
To do this it only has the logical widths of the string components. This results in a very sub-optimal 
line layout because it does not use any of the advanced typographical features available from the fonts 
such as using alternate glyphs or ligatures, optical bounds, etc. and results in very tricky problems 
when glyph clusters or reordering is involved.

So the root cause problem is that the justified layout of the runs (aka. portions in WriterSpeak) is done 
in the wrong layer. Writer should let the specialized layout engines do this. It itself should focus on 
distributing the available space to portions.

In practice this means that the DrawTextArray argument should not provide the pDXArray, but only the 
justified width. The cursor positions should be gotten from GetCaretPositions instead of GetTextArray, 
because the former provides the physical positions the latter allow only a rough calculation of the 
logical positions.

This all would not only result in a better typographic layout (on the reference device) but also in a 
much better readability on the screen. Currently the lower layers have no way of distinguishing a writer 
request for e.g. a tab position to e.g. an adjusting-to-reference-device rounding problem (such as

problem I've been experiencing all along with various versions.

Exporting an ODT file containing both words and inserted pictures to RTF is a
disaster.  The formatting is lost (eg centre justification goes to Left
justification and the picture size and location is lost.  So a three page
document can easily become 4 or 5 pages with great white gaps, pictures
misplaced onto the next page, some pictures missing and some on top of other
pictures.  The resulting file is completely unusable, but even if it were,
attempting to import the file into Word 2000 locked up my PC, requiring a
restart.  This is limiting my ability to get rid of Microsoft.  If I can't
generate files that all my microsoft-using friends can read, I can't communicate
with them.

More correctly, I can -- using the PDF converter which works very well -- but
that does not allow the MS-using friends to modify a file and collaborate.  

I wonder would this problem exist in Star Office?  Is it just that I am getting
what I am paying for?  I suspect it may very well exist there too, so am
reluctant to lay out money to find out.

OOO is a great application, but it is important that it can work properly with

"I would like to request an enhancement to the Notes functionality in Writer.  I 
would like to be able have a user-definable 'attribute' on each note with the 
following properties:

1:  The attribute provides a text name to be a 'type' for the note, 
selected from a user-defined list.
2:The type can be changed for an existing note.
3:Extend the current (very nice) layout/formatting of notes to 
assign (or allow assignment) of different background colours/shading/texture 
for each note 'type'
4:The notes view in navigator should distinguish between the 
types of note (options to group/sort by type would be very nice, but I wouldn't 
want to push my luck)
5:Note deletion should be limitable to a single note type, just 
as at present the notes for a single user can be deleted, or all notes can be 
deleted.
6:Note types would need a maintenance screen somewhere - I 
imagine this would depend on whether the definitions were based on installation 
instance, template or individual documents.  (My first instinct would be the 
template, with override at document level.)
7:If no types are defined, then presumably the system would 
define a 'default' type and hide the type-selection functionality until a user 
added more types.

Background explanation:
I use the notes functionality quite extensively and I find that for my own 
purposes, I want two different kinds of note, ideally readily distinguishable 
on the screen. (I could get something similar by logging-off and then logging-
on again as a second 'dummy' user, but that's a bit cumbersome.)

When I am preparing a document in conjunction with my partner, we will put 
notes in to highlight text which needs correcting, points needing clarifying 
etc, and over the course of preparing the final draft the notes are generally 
removed once we are both satisfied with the changes.

So far, so good, and well supported by the notes functionality as it stands.  
However, I also like to put in what might be described as 'meta data' notes.  
These are intended as reminders to myself or my partner what a particular 
paragraph, bullet point etc is meant to be for.  This is not information meant 
for the final recipient of the document, but as an additional layer of 
information for the benefit of the author(s).  It helps take some of the pain 
out of conversations which go 'That discussion paper we prepared last year... 
why did we say XXXX in paragraph four?'

At present, both of these types of note (content-correction & meta-data) are 
only distinguished by either reading them, or putting some sort of textual 
title at the top of the meta-data notes to help them stand out.  With the above 
requested functionality, I would be able to choose between entering two 
different types of note (or setting the note type once it was inserted) which 
would be visually distinguishable on the screen.

My specific approach to document preparation only needs two different types, 
but from a general point of view, simply having a generic 'attribute' with a 
user-definable set of values would probably be better. I am sure that there 
would be users out there who might want more than two flavours of note.  I can 
already see that if this functionality existed, we might well start using three 
note types: [issue_needs_fixing, meta-data, issue_is_fixed] which would allow 
us to easily track and then keep the discussion trail which led to the final 
draft as well as the meta-data and still be clear when issues were and were not 
resolved by changing the note type from '_needs_' to '_is_' fixed as we deal 
with each item.  

Clearly there is scope for confusion if you have multiple users working on a 
document and each can declare their own flavours of note. I can see a case for 
it being solely the document originator who defines note types, or note types 
are made common and accessible to all users.

"This is a feature that is lacking from all versions of open office 1, 2 and 3. 
AS the suite has become more professional, it is now time to add this feature of
parallel columns to the Writer.  It is a desperately needed feature for many
book writers, editors, and printers -- and it would really enhance the stature
of Open Office further above MS Word.  The basic needs are summarized in this Q:

http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=27859

Think of column flow DOWN pages (not across a page, like newspaper columns)--
column 1 of the odd page always carries down as column 1 of the odd pages, and
likewise for the other columns on odd or even pages.  

It is essential to allow for different setups of the odd and even pages, as this
is how most books large are printed.  The column layouts of the odd pages are
different than the even, as are the footer and header layouts.

It seems fairly easy to add this feature to the current set of Writer features.
 All you need is a 'parallel columns' choice, and these sub-choices:
1. make odd-page layout different(or same as) the even page layout
2. make odd page footer/header layouts different (or same as) even pages

There is a page setup for the odd pages and another for the even pages.  When in
column mode, Writer needs only check whether the new page is odd or even, to
decide the format. There also needs to be a way to change number of columns in
each layout without affecting the other.  

Then in 2 page facing view, all columns are lined up, and remain synchronized,
as the user scrolls down the pages.  Line synchronization is a crucial feature.

Obsolete WordPerfect used to do this (Word dropped it, and used tables, which OO
followed).  In both cases, the layout is unstable over long numbers of pages,
and is too easy in WordPerfect to destroy by accidentally moving a column line,
or in Word, by accidentally changing the table column size while editing.

Even in OO Writer, it is not possible to develop different column layouts for
odd and even pages, and have them persist down the pages.  Even if a table is
made, one cannot synchronize the lines, sentences or paragraphs without having
to repeatedly make new cells.  Also, a table change affects both pages, but in
parallel column book mode, the left pages are totally independent of the right.

Remember, when it comes to printing a book, you need separate pages in the
editor to be able to print the pages separately -- i.e. you cannot use a large
page size like 11x17 in landscape mode with 4 columns, because you can't print
the left and right 'pages' separately -- hence you cannot print the book.

Think how easily this new feature can be added to Writer.  It is the most
valuable enhancement you can add to the product -- no current word processor
does it correctly (Lotus WordPro and Wordperfect used to, but both fail at
maintaining the layout -- they are not robust). OO writer could do this easily.","ENHANCEMENT"

"In outline numbering I assign levels to headings. When I apply a heading
style on a paragraph, the relevant outline numbering for the relevant level
will be inserted in front of my text. I would like to specify the format of
the outline number. Using Tools->Outline numbering I can specify what level
numbers I want to see, what number style. I can also specify arbitrary text
before the numbers and after the numbers.
However, I can not specify the separator between the numbers.

If I am at Heading 3 (assigned to level 3) I can specify that I want to see
all level numbers, that I want level 1 to be shown as roman numeral, level 2 as
arabic and level 3 as alphabetical, with a leading text of '<' and trailing
text of '>'. Thus I will get something like this:

<III.2.f> Third chapter second subchapter sixth subsubchapter

But it is not possible to

- specify arbitrary text as a separator between the numbers. It is always
  a dot. It is not possible to create something like this:
  
  <III-2(f)> Third chapter second subchapter sixth subsubchapter

- change the order of the numbers, say reverse them like this:

  <f.2.III> Third chapter second subchapter sixth subsubchapter

What would be a nice way of doing it is if I could specify an arbitrary text
for level n outline numbering and special codes within the text would denote
the various level numbers and their preferred style. Like, for the previous
example I would write

<[1:roman]-[2:arab]([3:alpha])>

or, if I want to reverse the order of the numbering and use the conventionsl
'.' for separator, as in the second example:

<[3:alpha].[2:arab].[1:roman]>

where [n:xxxx] represents that I want the number for the n-th level in

Naturally some more appealing format and GUI to insert these
magic codes would be preferred, much like it is done in MS Word'97.

Separators other than the dot are frequently used in legal, religious
and business documents (and for the very reason, it would be very
good if special characters could be inserted too!).
 
The above specification would give the user complete flexibility

"OOo writer 3.2 does a jump where I think it should not (please correct me, if
I'm wrong)

* scroll down to one of the later pages
* switch to any other window
* switch back to OOo writer
* the view jumps back to the cursor but should IMHO stay where it is

Maybe this is the correct behavior, but at least I would love if this jump does
not happen. It often happens, that I scroll down to a specific position in the

switch back to writer the position of the document jumps back to the comment and

"Cross-references to footnotes aren't being resolved properly when a sub-document

I have attached 3 files: one master document and two sub-documents.
All 3 files have footnotes.
The sub-documents have two tables each.
The sub-documents have cross-references within their own files to footnotes in
those same files. (Insert/fielDs/Other/Cross-References/Footnotes, insert
reference to Reference).
Each table has (at least) 3 columns. The right-most column has either a footnote
or a cross-reference to a footnote. The 2nd column from the right indicates what
the footnote or cross-reference should be when the document is included in a
master document. The 3rd column from the right indicates what the footnote or
cross-reference should be when the document is viewed separately.

The first sub-document has its cross-references resolved properly. This can be
seen in the first two tables.

The second sub-document has its cross-references improperly resolved. Tables 3
and 4 show this. In Table 3, the row starting with a '3' should have the
cross-reference (the superscript after I0) of '8', but '7' shows up instead.
When viewed as a separate document, the superscripted cross-references in the
last two lines of the first table are properly resolved to '2'. As the 2nd
sub-document, these two lines should have the superscript '8'.

In Table 4, things get even worse. (Besides being wrong, the results are
different on different rows of the table.) The table rows starting with '4',

"I use Writer for academic articles in the field of Japanese Studies. They're in
German for the most part, except for single words and short phrases in Japanese
that are given in the original script for clarity. This kind of language mixing
is quite a hassle in OOo:
- A 12pt Japanese font has larger characters and much larger (vertical) line
spacing than a 12pt Western one, thus each line with Japanese characters in it
has more space above and below it than one without. That can be worked around by
using a smaller point size for Japanese text.
- given '... [Western text] [whitespace and or punctuation] [CJK text]
[whitespace and or punctuation] [Western text] ...'
OOo will always render everything right up to [CJK text] in the Western font and
size (OK),
 but even if I switch the input method back to German immediately after the last
CJK character any whitespace and or punctuation following it will still be
rendered in the CJK font and size. Only upon encountering a letter will OOo
switch back to the Western preset. So usually the space after a Japanese word is
noticeably wider than the one before it and commas and the like just look
totally out of place. Right now I work around this by selecting each of the
affected areas by hand and overriding size and font via the toolbar but it's an

    - insert a note into the document;

* try to change document zoom factor;
* some zoom factor values make the text exceed page margin (as the attached

* to get rid of this visual artifact one could do either of the following:
    - toggle View > Hidden paragraphs menu item;
    - make a minor change, save and reopen the document;
* the document view is refreshed so the artifact is not visible anymore until
you zoom the document again. But this refresh changes page layout. The attached

refreshing the view up to 3 lines could be moved to the new page. This is not

to be able to do that would be to create a graphic mage with the diagonal text
and insert it as a watermark. This is needlessly complicated for WP users and
most of our users would need help in doing this.

One way that I did find was:

1. Select/Create document
2. Insert-Frame. Select size/position/anchor point etc if required.
3. Select Borders tab.

Grey 10% - 30% would probably be ideal.

However, with this method I have not found a way of moving the text so it writes
diagonally across the page.

very common in business circles and we use the often here. A simpler and easier

"At present it is very troublesome to migrate MS-Word documents that include
embedded word-graphics to OOo (document.doc). When such documents are opened in
writer and saved as sxw (document0.swx), the word graphics are kept as they are:
OLE-objects of MS-Word. For a complete conversion to OOo these Word-objects also
have to be replaced by OOo-Objects.

The ultimate solution would be that OOo writer could do it automatically,
similar to Math Type formulas. The preferred target format should be draw.

But at present, even a manual conversion is troublesome: at first, one has to
open the Word-Graphics-Object in Word, save it as .doc (Grafik.doc) and then
open it in Writer. At this state you have an editable graphics in OOo
(Grafik0.sxw), that looks more or less like the word graphics. But what to do
with it?

One way could be to include this just converted graphics (Grafik0.sxw) as an
embedded or linked Writer object into document0.sxw instead of the original Word
graphics. The problem of this solution is that the Writer object cannot be
scaled, as it is possible for Draw objects. If you reduce the size of the object
only a part of its content is shown instead of a smaler image of the entire
content (see document1.sxw).

Another way is to copy&paste the graphics elements of Grafik0.sxw to Draw and
replace the Word-Grafics by a Draw-Object that can be scaled as required. But
here there is a problem with text elements. In Grafik0.sxw all text is included
in frames which are not known to Draw. So one has to copy the text of each frame
one by one to a textbox in Draw.

There could be two suboptimal solutions of the above ultimate solution to
facilitate manual conversion:

1) Make embedded Writer objects scalable

2) Implement a method to copy Writer text frames to Draw textboxes. For this
solution there is another hurdle, because at present it is not possible to
select multiple text frames in writer.

I will attach the following documents to explain the problem:
document.doc:  Word document including a Word Graphics
grafic.doc:    the embedded Word Graphics saved as external doc

grafic1.sxw:   a manually enhanced version of the previous file.
document.sxw:  how the ultimate writer document should look.

"I have recently come across a great article about font rasterization:
http://www.antigrain.com/research/font_rasterization/

And I'm wondering why OpenOffice.org doesn't use that algorithm to display fonts 
in the Print Layout mode. Currently, Openoffice seems to use variable distance 
between characters to fit the pixel grid, which doesn't look good:
http://habreffect.ru/files/252/7943c2ed9/openoffice-fonts.png

Instead, horizontal hinting and pixel alignment could be disabled altogether, 
utilizing subpixel rendering to achieve three times the screen resolution in 
that direction. The article goes into great depths as to why a small resulting 
fuzziness is a small price to pay for all the benefits it could bring.

I'm going to provide several examples on what this would mean for those who are 
unwilling to read the lengthy article (though I highly recommend it).

Smooth scaling:
http://www.antigrain.com/research/font_rasterization/text_ft_antigrain.png
Legible small fonts:
http://www.antigrain.com/research/font_rasterization/sample_arial_01.png
Exact positioning (smooth font shift by 3 pixels in 30 steps):
http://www.antigrain.com/research/font_rasterization/sample_arial_1tenth_shift.p
ng
Fancy effects without bluriness:
http://www.antigrain.com/research/font_rasterization/truetype_ft_lcd_bold1.png
http://www.antigrain.com/research/font_rasterization/sample_georgia_03_distorted
.png

I think that is pretty impressive. And it is possible with modern technology; a 
sample program, written three years ago, which demonstrates the abilities of the 
algorithm, is located here:
http://www.antigrain.com/research/font_rasterization/truetype_test_02_ft.zip

It's a Windows application, but it can be compiled for Linux, too. And it runs 
fine in Wine.

So, once again, what benefits this algorithm would provide:

'1. You can kern symbols with sub-pixel precision, not worrying about 
introducing extra blurriness.
2. You can freely scale the text as you want, with 100% guarantee of preserving 
a stable text layout that always fits other graphic elements.
3. You can always be sure that the calculated text width exactly corresponds 
with what you will see on screen and paper.
4. You can apply fancy vector effects such as 'faux bold' and 'faux italic' 
being sure the text will not look any blurrier.'

What needs to be done to achieve that:

'1. Use horizontal RGB sub-pixel anti-aliasing for LCD flat panels.
2. Use vertical hinting only and completely discard the horizontal one.
3. Use accurate glyph advance values, calculated at a high resolution for 
unhinted glyphs.
4. Use accurate, high resolution values from the kerning table.'

I have asked in the freetype mailing list, and it seems that all the building 
blocks needed for this to work have been around long ago, it's just that toolkit 
or end-user application uses it yet:

"Version control (VC) systems like Subversion, Git and the old CVS are extremely
practical programs that provide an unlimited undo function for documents. They
also allow to reconstruct a detailed timeline of changes inside a document which
comes in handy for documentation purposes in big development projects.
All VC systems do so by saving the differences between the current and the last
version of a document each time the user requests to remember that version. Some
VC tools like svn can even deal with binary (non text) data in a relatively
efficient way.

The issue now is that if compressed data is kept under version control even if
only one word in a document is changed big parts or even all of the compressed
data tends to change. Which means that when writing a 600-page-document
including 200 Megabytes of pictures and committing the data once every hour on a
10-hour-workday a compressed odt document might eat up 2 Gigabytes of server
place each day. An uncompressed document on the other hand occupies only the
place needed to store the text lines that actually have changed instead.
Since these few kilobytes will be compressed by most VC tools whilst the
compressed document won't get substantially shorter by being compressed again by
the VC tool the user might end up with a even bigger difference between
compressed and uncompressed document. 

There already is a extension to OOo that adds a GUI to control subversion from
Openoffice.org without addressing this issue. A second extension I know allows
to keep a single odt document in its own subversion repository (normally a whole
development project is kept in a repository). But until now as far as I know
openoffice lacks a solution for this problem.","ENHANCEMENT"

5) Watch carefully the extent of the selection's right boundaries
6) Copy the selection to the clipboard (Ctrl+C)

Actual result:
Copying to the clipboard causes the selection to be extended one character
toward the right on several lines.

See the attached screenshot for an example.

This does not always happen, but for a particular selection, it is mostly
reproducible. The exact result does seem to depend on exactly what is selected
and how the selection was made.

The changes always seem to be on the right side of the selection; I have not
seen the left-side boundaries change...

... Oops, I spoke too soon: if I start the selection at the right and move the
mouse up and to the left, then the boundaries on the left side change with copy.
It looks like the copy is somehow making a small change in the editing cursor
position and that triggers a change in the block selection boundary.

The problem is not that block selection is complex when the characters don't
fall in even columns, the problem is that the selection boundaries are changing

DRAWN ELEMENTS can be placed or moved outside the header and footer while still
anchored an empty paragraph inside, which is good for designing pages.

However, FRAMES and GRAPHICS are forced to stay in the vertical area defined by
headers and footers.  This is somewhat annoying, especially if you want to mix
design and function to the repeating elements in your page.  For instance, what
if you wanted to add page numbers and other information in the middle of the

"There have been complaints by many users in the Ubuntu community (myself
included). There have been some issues we have noticed with the default
OpenOffice 3.2 which comes included with Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx. All included
programs (Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw) takes an unusually long time to open
(whether it is a file, or the application itself), and to save.
It also effects OpenOffice 3.2.1, which I downloaded a few days ago to test. The
issue still remains.

We did notice, however, that the bug is caused by wired connections. A user who
accidently connected to a wireless network has said he did not experience the
same issues as with his wired connection. So it seems users who has a wired
connection (like me, I use ADSL) experience the issues I have explained. When I
disconnect my connection (auto EthO), the application and any file I wish to
open opens within a second, but when my internet is connected, it takes 15 to 20
seconds to load.

I will provide a link to the Ubuntu Forums, where the issue I have stated is

"Hi,

When working on Microsoft Word DOC format, removing a link doesn't reset the
test style to the normal/default one, but keeps the link style (blue and
underlined).

To reproduce the problem (1):
1. Open a Microsoft Word file (*.doc) that has a link.
2. Right click on the link, and chose 'remove hyperlink'.
3. Although it's not a link any more, it looks the same.

Doing the same steps with ODT format, gives the right effect.

The problem also exists when saving/exporting documents (even new documents) to
DOC format and then doing the steps above. So this is probably not a problem
with a specific document.

"When inserting a reference for a target, the type of naming for this reference

In some languages, such as Greek (and German I could think of), it is necessary
to change the 'category' name of an object, so that when the reference is used
in a text, it would be grammatically correct. 
The only way I found this could be done, is by using a plain text category
naming and referencing only by number. But this way, the linking is done only by
number.

My suggestion is that apart from the default naming, there should exist a field
for the user to enter custom text, also linking to a target.","ENHANCEMENT"
"The keybindings of Ooffice are counterintuitive and confusing.
It is possible to change these on the user level. However, It would
be preferable if ooffice was distributed with a set of alternative
pre-defined keybindings. Other software like eclipse or netbeans offer
a choice between MS style, emacs style, unix style. For a non-MS user
it is extremely confusing if Ctrl-A does not go to the beginning of the line,
if Ctrl-Z (rather than Ctrl-U) undoes etc etc.. The main motivation for
many ooffice users in the linux/bsd etc world is the ability to import,
change and export MS document styles. If, however, all predefined conventions
correspond to MS conventions rather than to the emacs conventions we are used to
since some 20 years, this is a major off-putting factor. All components of
Ooffice and not only the word processor suffer from this defect.","ENHANCEMENT"

maybe category/numbering.

So, either change it to 'numbering', or remove the default so you absolutely

3.2.1 on a 64bit Linux server for the first time and it's leaking horribly in

memory which is never released even after the document is closed and they return
to the Start Center.  Those that are opening and closing documents all day are
using 1, 2 or 3G of memory.  It's very easily to replicate.  I log in as a user,
and then just close and re-open documents the memory consumption goes up.

We never saw this issue on the 32bit version.

I'm attaching a screenshot of top showing how the users are using up far more
memory than they should.  

I tried to use valgrind, but was never able to get it past the first document
opened.  It continues to loop and report that Java was not found which is
blocking me from continued leaking.  I disabled Java and tried that and it's in
a loop requesting that I enable Java.   So the attached valgrind shows the first
document being opened, at which time I had to control-c out because of the java
dialog loop.  

Issues worth mentioning:

- THin clients are set to 16bit color depth.

"OOo 3.2 fixed a genuine problem wrt pasting numbered lists. See Issue 86492.
The fix has however introduced what I believe is unintended behaviour which is
causing me more grief than the original problem.
The new behaviour has already been described here
http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=28176
and in Issue 110110.

The problem reported in Issue 110110 is Closed (Won't fix) because it works as
per the specification - and it basically does, at least for simple examples.

I believe the specification needs additional clarification for more complex
situations. Let me explain.

Consider two lists:
1. itemA
2. itemB
3. itemC

1. itemD
2. itemE
3. itemF

If itemE is pasted into the first list in front of itemB, the intended result is:
1. itemA
2. itemE
3. itemB
4. itemC

and OOo 3.2 does this correctly.

Now consider these two lists:
1. itemA
2. itemB
3. itemC

1. itemD
2. itemE
 (a) sub-itemA
 (b) sub-itemB
3. itemE

If all of itemE is pasted into the first list in front of itemB, the intended
result (as produced by OOo 3.1) is:
1. itemA
2. itemE
 (a) sub-itemA
 (b) sub-itemB
3. itemB
4. itemC

But OOo 3.2 produces:
1. itemA
2. itemE
3. sub-itemA
4. sub-itemB
5. itemB
6. itemC

i.e. the numbering style at the insertion point is being applied to the whole
paste buffer contents, over-riding all pre-applied numbering including 'no
numbering'.
Furthermore, if a sub-item includes a table, the numbering is propagated through
every cell in the table!!! Hardly what was intended.

The relevant part of section 7.8 of specification
http://specs.openoffice.org/writer/numbering/NumberingBullet1.sxw is:
Clipboard content: Part/complete numbering and other paragraphs
Pasted Within a Numbering/Bullet list: Extend target numbering (Formatted text only)

I find the specification lacking in clarity when it comes to my second example,
particularly the meaning of 'Extend target numbering'.

For pasting style-formatted data within an existing list...
The OOo 3.1 interpretation is 'Adjust the numbering so the new data is part of
the existing list'.
The OOo 3.2 interpretation is 'Apply current numbering style to all of the new
data, regardless of whatever numbering may or may not already be applied to it'.

The former interpretation is more likely to produce the results the user is
expecting.

Certainly there were other pasting situations were OOo 3.1 was broken, but
pasting complex data into an existing list was not one of of them.","DEFECT"

Stack frame #40 is quite interseting, because it's the last one with a symbol. 
If I continue in the debugger for some seconds and then break again and do a

somewhere between #0 and #40.

Sometimes pressing home and end or clicking with the mouse on that suspicious

'ViewShell::ImplEndAction' function on the stack.

"In general OOo offers font types (printable/non-printable ones) depending on the
purpose of the apllication.

That means applications with a typically use case to print documents only
provide printable fonts. This prevents user error and invalid issue reports (of
course:-).

* example is the Writer.

Applications with a typical use case of generating online documents, are less
strict and provide *ALL* available fonts.

* example is Impress or HTML-Writer resp. Writer in Online Layout. Infact
switching the Writer from document view to Online Layout changes the amount of
available fonts.

Unfortunately the Insert/Special Character dialog doesn't care about the
application or the document view (Online Layout on/off).
It always provides *All* fonts.
This is problematic as users may for example choose mathematical symbols from
Insert/Special Character, which do not appear in the print-out later on (WAS
issue 17731).

the 'Insert/Special Charactr' dialog should display fonts in accordance to the

"The find and replace dialog is a cluttered mess, especially now that we have 
regex searching working properly.

One measure to improve it would be to unify the two buttons presently listed as 
'format' and 'attributes' The separation between “attributes” and “format” is 
confusing to the user and should be abolished. At the moment, the user has to 
choose twice, in two separate dialogues, to do something as simple as searching 
for bold text. I can’t see why (except from the PoV of the API, which should be 
invisible). 

If the user selects “bold” in the format section, the program ought to assume 
that they want to search in the font-weight attribute. Otherwise, why ask for 
'bold'? OO Writer ought not to ignore the selection under format, as it does 
now,  until the user opens the 'attribute' button and scrolls through a huge and 
non-intuitive list to tick 'font weight' and then closes that (a third mouse 
click!) before pressing 'find'.

Steps to see why this is a good idea: Try a moderately complex search and

"Hi,

a user of Czech version suggested this enhancement:

OOo is often over-intelligent with autocorrect turned on (this is the default).
E.g. we have many names and words with TWo INitiall LEtters in CApital, like
EBanka etc. It would be nice to confirm or decline the usage of this specific
(and others too) autocorrect feature at the first run. The situation would be:

- User first starts OOo
- he writes the word EBanka
- after space, the word is changed to Ebanka and the dialog will pop-up
informing the user about this specific autocorrect feature.

  User now can press:

  - Accept in this case (also means do not ask in the future and apply this
autocorrect feature in the future)
  - Decline (and disable this autocorrect feature)
  - maybe other modifications (like Accept or Decline with 'Apply this specific
AutoCorrect feature in the future' checkbox turned on by default)

Additional related suggestion: Perhaps also have line breaks counted for people
who want that statistic as well.

Basically, my thinking is the fact that since every hard return is counted as a
paragraph. If you have a user who puts two returns after every paragraph, it
will appear to them as if they have double the paragraphs that they really have
in the document. If the desire to keep the linebreak statistic is there, then

"This reports regards two types of anchored objects, namely page and paragraph
anchored objects.

First, page anchored objects are seemingly anchored to the page by number and
not by object, which means that inserting a page will cause the object to remain
on a page with the same number as before, causing the layout to be destroyed.

Second, on multi-column pages (2 at least =), paragraph anchored objects, which
have a horizontal size greater than the column will extend beyond the column
frame, which is ok. But, these objects will destroy the overall page layout in
that they will extend far to the right, eventually ignoring the page's right
margin. When being greater in size than the column frame's offset left plus what
is remaining to the page's right margin it will be partly not visible.

My proposal is as such: Allow free horizontal movement of the paragraph anchored
object, by merely asserting that it's top border matches the paragraphs offset top. 

Second, it would even be nice to allow the object to be freely moved while still
being paragraph anchored. This would allow for some extra space at the top of
the object to be inserted at will by the layouter. An assertion must be made
though that the object must not be able to be moved negatively beyond the
paragraphs offset top. To the left, right and below is free to the user then.","ENHANCEMENT"

"Consider a two column or one column page which has footnotes. The page is
already layouted so that it's layout items (text/objects) fill up most of the

height according to the text being entered. It will expand until it causes the
page break or re-layouting of the elements on the page, then it will itself
break up and consume space on either the next page or next column. 
This causes the original layout to be destroyed and, eventually causes at least
one page break. I don't necessarily think that this is intentional ;-)


Proposal:

Before breaking the layout, the footnote should only be allowed to expand in

"It would be nice if there was a way to insert an object as a URL with specified
text instead of being OLE.  The object should be a file, and the file needs to
be added to the sxw file.  Then, when the link is clicked on, a copy of the file
should be extracted somewhere and whatever the default application is for that
type of files would be started.  Alternatively, you could 'save' the file to a
specified location.  Essentially this is the email attachment mechanism, but
added to documents instead of email.

The use for this is to allow additional information to be added to a document
when there isn't really any OLE type mechanism available to support embedding
the file directly in the document.  It is also useful to allow files to be
embedded on Linux and other operating systems that don't support OLE, but may
support applications other than the Open Office ones.","FEATURE"

"Proposal to remove the font menu from the context menu.

Reasons:
- Technical limitations: because of performance problems we had to reduce the
amount of fonts displayed in the this menu (issue 61775).

Which systematic did we use to choose which fonts should be displayed?
-> the first 100 entries sorted alphabetically.
This means on a system with hundred*s* of fonts that fonts like Symbol, Times
new Roman or Windings (rather common fonts) won't be displayed because there
name is out of 'Top 100' list. Useless.


- Missing features (or bugs) we won't implement (fix):

a) Such a context menu cannot have a preview like the toolbar font menu.
Looking for a suiting typeface without preview is awkward.

b) The menu entries cannot be reached by typing the first letter of the font
name. Reaching entries via keyboard input is essential in long lists.

Final small argument: cluttering the display with such a huge menu is ugly.

We should have a look on the usage tracking on this menu.
I suppose the amount is not very high.","ENHANCEMENT"
"When opening the font menu the current active font should be visible, but
sometimes isn't. When a user has a large list of fonts then the font menu
becomes very long. When opened the font menu only shows the first 50 fonts in
alphabetical order. To reach a later font the user has to scroll down a long
list (screenheight) and scroll further to reach the current or next font.
Imagine a user who wants to try out several different fonts for a piece of text.
For every attempt he has to scroll down this very long list, which is very
tedious. What should happen is that when a user opens the font menu he is always
presented with the font list positioned such that the currectly active font is
clearly visible. This would enable him to immediately click on the next font in
the list. This can then be repeated until all desired fonts have been tried.

In summary: the current font menu only works fine for systems with less than 50
fonts, but is user-unfriendly for systems with many more.","ENHANCEMENT"

manually enter the correct 'Path' element (typically, /usr/bin/kmail). This is

First, OOo should probably suggest a reduced list of email programs based on the
executables it has detected in the $PATH environment, and use the equivalent of
unix `which` to impute the expected value for the 'Path' component of the setup

effects, often for just a single character.  After updating to the version of 
3.2.1 referenced above, the slash and X strikethroughs affect not only the 
selected character, but the next character as well. It does this not only for 
new stuff I'm typing with strikethroughs, but it also displays existing 
strikethroughs (i.e. ones that I typed with the older version of OpenOffice) as 
doubles. It even shows me that it is going to (wrongly) do this in the preview 
pane on the Font Effects screen itself, EXCEPT that in the preview pane, it 
shows the selected letter slashed, and a space afterward (I've linked a screen 
shot below – notice that I selected the “u”, but it's showing a “u” and a space 
both slashed).

space is gone, and instead both the u and the next letter, the m, are slashed

change the style of the selected paragraph.

(2) But if you use the style catalog to *modify' paragraph's styles (especially
if you modify styles which you *just* *want* *to* *modify* *but* *not* *apply*
to the current selected paragraph -> then clicking 'ok' is wrong but 'close' is
the right choice (since you don't want to apply the modified style to the
selected paragraph). Few people will in this case keep in mind the difference
between 'ok' and 'close'. So please, rename the 'ok' button 'apply' which is a
better choise even in case 1 (see above).

"Goal: Create a long outline and automatically produce a (condensed) table of
contents from the top two levels of the outline.

Approach: Use conditional paragraph styles for the outline items and set the
Outline & Numbering > Outline > Outline level property for the styles applied at
the top two levels.

That should allow the ToC to pick up the desired items from the outline.

Problem: This works for the first creation of the ToC; however, if the outline
structure is changed and the ToC updated, items at new levels may appear in the
ToC when they should not, or may appear at the wrong level in the ToC.

It seems this happens because the outline level property does not get adjusted
when the list level changes (promote/demote) and a new paragraph style takes
effect. Format > Paragraph > Outline & Numbering after promoting or demoting the
item shows that the property has not changed along with the other style properties.","DEFECT"

"Hello,

I hope that I am addressing this issue to the right team.

I prepared a Word (MS Word 1997-2003)  file for compatibility reasons with the
people that are supposed to get it. Later I tied to modify it with Open Office
Writer. What a surprise the colors of some lines had been changed as well as the
formating of a few lines. When I generate a PDF file from Word then I get what
was expected and when I generate a PDF file of the same source file from Open
Office Writer the PDF file reflects the problems I have when opening the file
with Writer.
If required, then I can send a copy of the source file as well as copies of the
2 gen,generated PDF files to an E-mail address providing I can get one.

Yet I cannot find any way to do this in OOo. When I modify the page layout it 
always applies to the whole text and I can see no feature to allow it to apply

-whether to hyphenate them as the other text or not,
-whether to use hyphen as separator, other character or none at all,
-whether to hyphen words or not,
-whether to hyphen before or after which characters (slash and points).

"Overview
--------
When dragging a section heading from the Navigator, Writer adds the entire
section as a copy instead of adding the hyperlink to the section heading. 

Steps to Reproduce
------------------
- Create a new document.
- Add two headings and some text in a paragraph below each heading.
- Open the Navigator.
- Set the Drag Mode to Hyperlink.
- Drag the second heading from the Navigator's Headings section to the end of
the paragraph below the first heading.

Actual Results
--------------
Writer adds entire section as a copy.

Expected Results
----------------
Writer adds a hyperlink to the section with the section heading as text.","DEFECT"
"At the moment, it is not possible to paste contet of tables (cut in another

As example.
Try in writer:

- type some TExt / values in the 1st table's cells
- select 1st table and copy content to clipboard
- set the cursor to the 1st cell of 2nd table
- paste the clipboards table
-> the content will be pasted to each single cells and give a copy of the 1st table

Try with Writer / Calc:
- use the tables from the recent example (content should already be in clipboard)
- paste clipboard to a calc sheet
-> Table in calc looks similar to that in writer
- select all new cells in Calc and copy to clipboard
- go back to writer, select table 2, cell 1 and paste the clipboard's content
-> you have no chance to get the same results as when copying writer -> writer

It is a fundamental question, which applies to all borders - Table border,

Use dotted line to represent hidden borders / text boundaries

I know you can press Find All to highlight all instances, then choose Format -
Default to remove any direct formatting. However, this indeed removes any direct
formatting such as super and subscripts, font colors, etc, and not only italics.

A more precise control of what formatting to remove and what not indeed on its

"The .doc extension is widely used not to define a fiel format but as a 'open it
with my Word editor' (whatever it is). This is especially used with the exchange
format MS Word XML 2003 wich is used by 'generating doc files' programs. Indeed,
in most OS's, the .xml extension will open a text editor.

By default, opening a MS XML 2003 terminated by .doc is impossible, as it
doesn't allow you to choose it in the file selector (restricted to .xml), and
provides an ascii filtering system, if opening by the standard way.

I propose to either make the ASCII detection less 'dummy' and detect what XML
is, so that the XML 2003 importer will work, either add in the defaukt
OpenOffice configuration that the .doc might eventually be an XML.
This last point is seen in 'Tools'->'XML Filter options' (i guess the english
labels as my oo is french). Then in the extension part of 'MS Word 2003 XML' it
consist in having 'xml;doc' instead of 'xml' only.

"Hi,
the writer app could conquer a wide spread and very common task of any office
with a new feature -- something what can't be done with the writer nor with ms
word up to now.

The scenario:

* you have a writer template with a table and fields in it like this
<position> <amount> <productname> <singleprice>
* you have a calc sheet used as a data source

The problem:

* you can't insert more than one row of the data source (in the F4-database
view) into an *existing* preformatted table
* (there is the fantastic feature to create a *new* table, however this is not
compatible with a template which has an *existing* table.)

The feature enhancement request:

* If existing fields are updated from a data source AND
* these fields are already placed inside of an existing table THEN
* there should be a dialog if to insert a new line to the existing table, be
filled with the same field-types and be filled with the data base's contents.

Sorry, if this sounds a bit too much for an enhancement but as I noticed that
there is already a feature to create a new table formed form several rows in the
data source I hope there is a way.

Finally:

* Although this would be an excellent feature -- on the long term I see some
conceptional problems: How would the writer app and the user determine which
fields are 'repeater'-fields (e.g. <productname>, <singleprice>) and which one
are 'one time update' fields (like <sum> or <totalprice>)? Maybe the mentioned
dialog is the first approach to solve this.","FEATURE"

"The outline numbering dialog [Format->Styles->Catalog->Numbering Styles->Modify]

controls out of order: 'Spacing to text'  affects the second line of a

paragraph.  This is counter-intuitive; they should be listed in reverse order,
ie, in the order that the visual representation in that tab suggests - first
line, then second line.  The order of controls for alignment of the first and
subsequent lines of a paragraph should be swapped to be in a more logical sequence.

it's not clear how 'Spacing to text' is different to 'Indent', until operating
the control shows that it indents all of the paragraph except for the first
line.  So why not call it 'Second line indent'?.  At least that would suggest
its function.  The 'Spacing to text' term should be changed to something less
confusing, such as 'Second line indent', or similar.

"The outline numbering dialog [Format->Styles->Catalog->Numbering Styles->Modify]
is a poorly-implemented GUI.  In the Position tab, the meaning of 'Minimum
spacing numbering <-> text', is reasonably clear, but its effect is
inconsistent.  The term 'Minimum spacing', suggests that the text will begin at
the next tab stop, unless the spacing from the numbering to the first tab stop
is less than the 'Minimum spacing' specified, whereupon the text will begin
after the first tab stop, after inserting that 'Minimum spacing' between the
numbering and the text.  And that's the observed behaviour for outline numbering
at levels two and greater, but for level one, the 'Minimum spacing' is applied
regardless.  There seems to be no way of making level one text begin at the
first tab stop after the numbering.  This results in text in level one
paragraphs being badly aligned with the text of other levels and makes alignment
with these other outline levels impossible.  The behaviour of spacing after
numbering in level one paragraphs should be changed to make it consistent with
the behaviour of levels two and above.  For tidy formatting, my organisation
requires that the start of text in numbered paragraphs lines up with the
numbering of paragraphs in the next level, so this is a showstopper for me.

subsequently select one of these options and click OK, your previously entered
settings are lost.  Your only recourse after a wayward click is to re-enter all
your settings.  As well, if you enter this dialog some time later, there is no
way of knowing which of the examples in the Outline tab hold your settings. 
Again, if you click on the wrong one and click OK, your settings are lost for
good.  Expected behaviour for a useful GUI is for the entered Position and
Options settings to be reflected in the Outline tab, that they be saved for
later review, and that the example modified appear as the selected outline when
opening the dialog while the cursor is in a paragraph holding that numbering
style.  The Position and Options settings of the dialog should be reflected in
the Outline tab example that was modified to accept those settings, and all of
this should be saved for later selection and review.  Additionally, the modified
example in the Outline tab should be the default selection when opening this
dialog from a paragraph containing this particular numbering style.

if some text happens to be capitalised, then it will not be rendered as the user

"OOo 3.2.1 (OOO320m18) has Find & Replace feature that behaves strangely using
regular expression which has been present for more than a year.

I inadvertently thought this was a more over-arching problem, but it appears to
only occur in limited circumstances.

Using Find & Replace in a text document that has more than one paragraph:

(1)  Choose Find & Replace from the Edit menu.
(2)  Select 'More options.'
(3)  Check the 'regular expressions' box.
(4)  Put '$' in the 'Search for' box. - $ is reg exp for end of paragraph.
(5)  Put '\t' in the 'Replace with' box.  - \t is reg exp for tab.
(6)  Select 'Replace all'.

Find & Replace will Find correctly the end of each paragraph, but will Replace
the paragraph break with the literal '\t' rather than the tab character that the
reg exp represents.

A workaround is to put '.$' in the 'Search for' box and '$\t' in the 'Replace
with' box, but this workaround is not particularly obvious.

Another quirk:

(4) Put '^' in the 'Search for' box - ^ is reg exp for beginning of paragraph.

When searching for this reg exp alone, it does not identify any paragraph
breaks, whereas when searching for '$' alone does identify paragraph breaks. 
This may be intentional, but if so you may think about changing the
documentation ('list of regular expressions') to reflect the difference in the
two reg exp.

These types of searches are very useful for reformatting data for calc
spreadsheets.  I think it likely that I am not the only one using it for this
purpose.","DEFECT"

<Taken from JHW<s post on the users mailing list, since she put it more
eloquently that I>

This function is needed for producing final copy in many situations. For
example, I've often produced software manuals in which the changed lines or
paragraphs are marked by vertical bars, but the text shows only the latest
version of the text. Readers often want to be able to quickly find the new or
changed info (for example, where the descriptions are of how to use new software
features, or where corrections have been made in the document).

At the moment you can do most of the job by accepting all the deletions (which
then are removed completely from the file), changing the display of additions to
use no special formatting or color, and having change bars turned on. This works
fine unless you don't add something on the same line where you've deleted
something. It's also no good if you want the deletions retained in the file for
archive purposes, though a workaround for that is simply to archive the file
with all the changes included, and then make the final published version from a
copy of that file.","ENHANCEMENT"

1- Install Linux Libertine G font from here: http://numbertext.org/linux/
2- Open a Writer document and type the following text

Some text \prime Some text fi more text

3- Modify the paragraph style to use the Linux Libertine G font with 'tex mode'
enabled (on the font name box type: Linux Libertine G:texm=1)
'\prime' will change into ' and fi will be replaced with proper typographical
ligature.
4- Put the cursor on the end of the paragraph and use the cursor arrows to go to
the left one character at a time.

Actual result:
While the cursor behaviour is OK on the fi ligature (and this is an improvement
respect OOo 3.2.x), when you arrive to the 'prime' the cursor will jump to the
right, possible going to the position where the text \prime should be if 'tex
mode' were not enabled.

This behaviour is confusing because the cursor jump to a text position, but if
you press 'back space' the text deleted is the one 'hidden' by the Graphite

"When editing a document, it is often desireable to choose what format context to
be in when inserting text at the boundary between two formats. For instance, if
I have inserted a Hyperlink into my document and I click at the 'point' (don't
know the OOo term for the point between one character and the next where the
cursor is positioned... so I'll use 'point' in this description...) immediately
after the last character of the Hyperlink and before the next character in my
document (just regular text for the sake of argument), I might want to type in
the Hyperlink text context (to add something to the text for the Hyperlink) or
the regular text context (perhaps to add a space or punctuation). As it is now,
typing at that 'point' will always be within the context of the Hyperlink, no
matter how my cursor got to that 'point'. A good example is a Hyperlink followed
by a comma. If I want to add a few words after the Hyperlink but before the
comma, I have to position the cursor to the right of the comma, type the space
and words I want and a new comma, then go back to the 'point' after the original
comma and press backspace to delete the original comma.

The same is true of editing at the boundaries of text with italics or other text
formats, and some other text format.

The solution that I am used to is that the text format context at 'point' is the
context that the cursor was last in. So, for instance, if I clicked somewhere in
the text for a Hyperlink (although any text format/context will do) and used the
cursor keys to move to the 'point' immediately after the last character in that
context, if I typed I would still be in that context. However, if I clicked on
text in the region after the Hyperlink context (where 'after' means further
along in the direction of left/right or right/left text), and used the cursor
keys to move back to the 'point' immediately after the last character in the
Hyperlink -- but without 'entering' that context -- when I typed text, it would
be in the context of the text after the Hyperlink. If I clicked at a 'point'
with the mouse, then the behaviour would be identical to its current
implementation, and the context would be that of the text immediately before the
'point'.

I find that when I'm working on documents that I am faced with this issue
several times an hour, and I presume that others are facing similar issues, so I
set the priority a bit higher.","ENHANCEMENT"

"I have found this problem in every version of Openoffice that I have tried, not
just the version selected above, which is the latest I am using.

I hate using a mouse, and like to use arrow keys to move up and down when
reading documents.

Unfortunately at page breaks and paragraph breaks instead of smoothly continuing
across the break the text suddenly jumps so that the eye has to search for the
line that was last being read. This is utterly disconcerting to me, and wastes a
huge amount of time when I am reading a document.

To observe this simply read in any openoffice or word text file then click on
some text to locate the text cursor, and then press the down arrow key. Watch
the text jump as the cursor passes a paragraph or page boundary. See if you can
read anything like that. The same happens with the up arrow key. Contrast the
nice line-at-a-time vertical scrolling if you use the mouse to click on the
arrows at top and bottom of scroll bar.

I presume this jumpting behaviour was put in because someone did not like to see
a small part of the next paragraph or next page as the cursor moves down (or up)
the page. And I suppose some people never notice it because they do everything
with a mouse and you don't get the problem if using the mouse and scroll-bar.

If this discontinuous keyboard-driven vertical motion really is the preferred
behaviour of the majority of non-mouse users, please can it be made switchable
for people who hate it?

I.e. if you pres UP or DOWN arrow you should be able to get the same behaviour
as is already provided by clicking on the arrow at top or bottom of the scroll
bar. My hunch is that most people would prefer that to be the default for arrow
keys also, but even if I am wrong, at least people who want it should have it as
an option.

Open Office cut off several pages we have to use Word for Mac to see these pages.

"I see three numbering features:

1. Line Numbering
2. Numbered Lists as opposed to Bulleted Lists
3. Chapter Numbering

If you, at once, know what I am talking about here lets choose these three.

The present terminology in the OOo GUI refers to these three as

1.  'Line Numbering' - which is fine.

2.1 Icon toolbar: 'Numbering On/Off'
2.2 Stylist: Among styles categories there are 'Numbering Syles',
    which comprises both numbered lists being refered to as
    'Numbering' and bulleted lists being referred to as 'Lists'.
    Note that each styles dialog contains a tab 'Outline'.
2.3 Stylist > Paragraph styles > View 'List Styles' which are obv.
    paragraph styles used for both numbered or bulleted lists.
2.4 Format > 'Numbering/Bullets'
    Note that here the GUI contains a tab 'Outline' too.

3   > Tools > Outline numbering - which is obviously wrong:

Outline means multilevel numbering. Which would therefore apply to both Numbered
Lists and Chapter Numbering. So all which needs to be done is to

a:  clean up the slight inconsistencies in the numbered/bulleted
    lists terminology
b:  Replace Outline Numbering in the Tools menue by
    'Chapter Numbering'

I can reproduce this error with OOo 3.2.1, 3.3.0RC7 and StarOffice 9.2.0.

I received a complaint about lost pictures in big documents. The most pictures
are inserted with copy-paste from calc to different tables in the writer.

I can reproduce this error with a testfile (test.odt).

How to reproduce:
- Open the testfile
- Add or change same text
- Save the file
- Relaod the file
Now the most pictures under point 2 (Retention test) are not there anymore.


I open both files as ZIP and find the following differences:

1. when I open the file:
  - Dir Pictures contain 10 Pic.
  - in Manifest.xml 10 Pic. are on the list
2.after changes and save
  - Dir Pictures contain only 2 Pic.
  - also in Manifest.xml 2 Pic. are on the list

This happens not with NeoOffice 3.1.2 Patch 2 and not under Linux(Ubuntu) and
WindowsXP.

"It appears that the Z-order of objects within a frame can be scrambled when
saving an odt file in Writer. 

Example file:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1735103/Figure%20z%20order%20problems%204.odt

In the example file linked above, the arrows were all placed above the JPEG
images when the file was created, however, when it is opened, figures 9 onwards
have been corrupted, and the arrows are now below the JPEG images. This file
seems to render identically on different computers running the same version of
OOo (3.2.0) on Windows XP.

Second example file:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1735103/Figure%20z%20order%20problems%205.odt

The same file, again with all of the arrows positioned above the JPEG images,
was saved to odt format using a different (slower) computer running the same
version of OOo. This file again appears to render identically on different
computers, but the corruption of the images is different to that in the previous
file.

This implies to me that the corruption is taking place when the file is saved,
rather than when it is opened, although I may be wrong. 

This erroneous behaviour seems to be highly variable. It only seems to affect
files with many images - the attached files exhibited no problems until around
12 complex images with Z ordered features were added.

I see a few other bug reports relating to Z order, but in slightly different ways:

"Changing the image anchor from 'To paragraph' (the default) to 'To Character'
(or 'To Page' or 'As Character') makes the image's text alternatives (i.e. title
and description) disappear. Changing the anchor back from 'To Character' to 'To
Paragraph' has the same effect. ('Undo' does not restore the text alternatives.)

Steps to reproduce the issue:
1. Create a new document; enter a few paragraphs of text.
2. Between two of the paragraphs, add an image through the menus Insert >
Picture > From file...
3. Right-click on the image, go to 'Description' and fill in the fields Title
and Description. Quit the Description dialog.
4. (Save the document.)
5. Right-click on the image, go to 'Anchor' and change the value from 'To
Paragraph' to any of the other values. Quit the dialog.
6. Right-click on the image, go to 'Description' and check the values Title and
Description: they are now empty.

Current workaround: set the anchor first, and then the Title and Description.
Few people will be aware of the disappearing Title and Decription and think of
the workaround.
The title and description are needed for blind users (or any screen reader
users) and for exporting to audio books (e.g. in the DAISY format, with the OOo
extension odt2daisy). In other words, it's an accessibility issue.","DEFECT"

PDF, the insertion bar positions itself after the numbered part of a
Header/Outline title and before the first letter of that same Header/Outline
title, and this regardless of numbered style used. For precise navigation and
accessibility reasons -- especially when the page is zoomed in at more than 100
percent of the screen -- the current insertion bar should, by default, insert
itself at the beginning of the numbered section of a Header/Outline in order for
Users to be able to view all other possible numbered Headers/Outlines that
follow the same vertical alignment without having to scroll more to the left
(since the numbered part is hidden from view -- annoying and impractical when
reading consecutive numbered Headers/Paragraphs/Text, especially in
judicial/legal documents).

This missing aspect of navigation should not be considered trivial and should be
made optional via any dialog box accessing numbering functionality for any type
of Writer content. Current relevant dialog windows should comprise of radio
buttons allowing Users to choose either to leave, as default, the current
position of the insertion bar once jumping to a referenced numbered item (i.e.:
Insertion bar Default: 'Right of numbering') or, to position in front of
numbered item (i.e.: Insertion bar Option 1: 'Left of numbering') or, to
position at left margin of page on same line as numbered item (i.e.: Insertion
bar Option 2: 'Left margin').

Practically speaking, two radio buttons would suffice: the default enabled radio
button would apply Option 1, with the choice to choose Option 2 via another
radio button.

This Enhancement can also be categorized as a 'Feature' where the Insertion bar
currently omits to take into account the numbering part of a Header/Outline, or
as a 'Defect' where the Insertion bar is supposed to anchor in front of any
numbered List items.","ENHANCEMENT"

Hi Marc,

As most busuinesses I know need to produce such a list from Customers,
Suppliers or whatever, I thought your requirement was important to check
out.

I always thought when I first tried this it was just me.

>From my testing (and I can be wrong) the Form Letter facility does exactly
what you say.  It creates for each page of addresses a single file which
starts again at page one.  I hope I'm wrong but if it isn't this is a very
severe limitation.

What I have learned from your question is that Form Letter does not work as
I expected and it probably really should not be used in conjunction with the
Next Record facility.  That is it is only good for merge a letter to a a
record, not to create continuous list.

The approach that does work in Writer is to use the Data to Form feature.

If you think this is a shortcoming of the product (and I think it is) then
you may wish to request an enhancement.

I should also be fair here.  I don't like the way word processors generally
handle mail merge and I think you should be able to simply put in the first
layout for the first record and then put in a repeat for all select records.
That's just me.

First create your document and insert your header and footer.

Put in the first entry of your merge fields in the layout you want including
the Next record field plus any required blank lines.  (You may also want to
use the hidden paragraphs and hidden text features.)

Now copy the layout enough times to cater for the number of members you
have.  Control-V is much faster to paste.

I would suggest at this stage saving the document as a template and then
opening it using File -> New -> Templates.

Now select your records in the data source view and click on Data To Fields
and you will see your records in the current document.

The document should have pages where they are supposed to be and page
numbers as desired.

The final step will probably be to insert manual page breaks to get the page
breaks in sensible locations.

Don't forget also that OpenOffice.org has excellent facilities to produce
your address book as a booklet that can be easily folded and used as a
reference.  I make this available on my website for others if you need to
know  about it.

I would like to have OO to print form fields without the surrounding borders, as
to make them part of the text and not to stand out and thus destroying both
layout and appearance of the printed text.

I scanned through the options (appearance and printing of text documents) but
neither would allow an option to switch of borders of these form fields,
especially text and select box fields.

As for Radio Buttons or Check-Boxes, alternative displays when being printed
would also be very nice, for example render check boxes without the surrounding
  borders and plainly the checkmark. The same with radio buttons, that would
then be rendered when being printed in the same way as checkboxes are, just the
plain checkmark. However, this needs to be user-configurable.","ENHANCEMENT"

"I created a table in a new Writer document and it looked OK.  When I merged the
cells in the first row, a large gap appeared under the first row, and the second
and subsequent rows were pushed down to the top a new page.  If I save and
re-open the document, the gap is still there.  I attached the file to my forum
post - it is test table.odt at
http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/download/file.php?id=10296.  Sorry
but I cannot see how to attach the file to this bug report.

I also see similar behaviour when I use a Master document and I pull in a
sub-document which comprises a table.  The table often (10%?) breaks between
rows with a large gap, and subsequent rows start at the top of a new page. 
Using Navigator to move the position of the sub-document up or down usually
removes the gap.  So does updating the sub-document.

Detailed description.  

The file test table.odt was created by:
1 Start OOo, create a new Text document, copy about 2 pages of text from a .txt
file, and paste it into Writer with Ctrl/v
2 Delete excess text, leaving one page of text with one blank line below the
text on page 1
3 Add the table shown using the pulldown from the table icon in the taskbar - it
had no gap when added
4 Merge the cells in the top row of the table to form a single row. >>>>> At
this stage the gap appeared after row 1 - row 2 was pushed to the start of page 3
5 Save the file as test table.odt
6 Close the file
7 File > Recent documents > select test table.odt >>>> the gap appears

Workaround to remove the gap:

Doing almost anything to the document seems to remove the gap.  For example,
changing the size of the blank line at the end of page 1 from 11pt to 22pt
causes the gap to disappear.  Adding an extra paragraph return (by typing enter)
below the text on page 1 so as to push the table one line lower makes the gap
disappear.

It does it every time I open the file.

I am running OOO320m18 Build 9502 under W7 Home Edition 64 bit on an Intel dual
core. 

I submitted a post at
http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=37845&p=173714#p173714
which describes it and has had several responses.

I have been experiencing these gaps a lot in Master documents for 2 years or so.
I use OOo for a magazine where each of 40 to 50 articles is a sub-document
typically 1/4 to about 1 page long. I often (less than 10% of the time) get
random gaps in the master. When I get them, they can be made to disappear by
updating the sub-document, or by moving it up or down the document with
Navigator. When I have the problem, it is reproducably the same articles which
give gaps when I update the document, and large tables are much the worst,
sometimes giving several gaps.  The documents starts off OK and no gaps appear,
but after working with it a lot, gapos start to appear, and once tghey have
started to appear, they reappear reproducably in the same sub-documents in the
same places. 

I had thought it was a Master problem, but seeing the problem in the table in
the standalone test document leads me to believe it is in the table itself.
Shortening an article by removing a line, or reducing the gap at the end of the
paragraphs stops the gaps appearing.

I have convinced myself that it is probably because OOo is making a mistake when
it calculates the length of something, and then decides it won't fit on the page
so it starts at the next page, or starts the following article lower than it
should be. If an article repeatedly causes the problem, creating a new, empty
text document and Select All > copy > paste into the new sub-document, usually
stops it happening when I use the new sub-document instead of the old. Sometimes
articles just space themselves a few mm apart - ie a gap of a few mm - and
updating the article removes the gap. It is not because I have large gaps below
paragraphs and these are spilling out of the article - I use a macro to set all
'last line in the article' to 0mm gap below paragraph.","DEFECT"

numbering in the imported document only made the first digit superscript, and

only the digit '2' was superscripted.

Another probled - but not necessarily OO. One of the reasons I imported the 
document into OO was because I had deleted footnote 242 and MS Word refused to 
renumber, thus leaving me with 241 followed by 243. I hoped that OO would 
renumber automatically, but it left the same gap in numbers.

look in the text itself, footnote 11 repeats '11' for the next ten footnotes,

"In my native language Dutch there several words written the same way but adding
e.g. an apostrof changes the meaning slightly. E.g. 'een' means 'a' or 'an' in
Enlish and 'één' means 'one' in Enlish.
I would like to propose and easy way to switch between the words by introducing
kind of a synonym list. This way you don't have to remember alt codes to add
e.g. 'é'. I believe this is also kind of being done in M$ Word.
To implement this I've got two suggestions:

1 - Words which have a synonym in a db can get a different underline in the
actual text. Like it's being done now with misspelled words but in a different
color maybe. This way alle the synonyms can be listed in the context menu.
2 - A seperate dropdown in the main toolbar which lists all the synonyms of the
wordt the cursor is positioned on.

The first option might cause the document view to become a bit too busy. The
underline could be left out completely but imo this might cause some confusion
because you would never know for which words synonyms will be available.
To overcome the problems option two might be the best one to use. A combination
of both could be used as well of course. This way we can leave it up to the
users to enable and disable what they prefer.","ENHANCEMENT"

The AutoComplete feature in OOO is very nice, but there's just one ehancement to
it I'd like to see. If I make spelling mistakes, the incorrectly spelled words
are of course collected along with the correctly spelled ones - very logical.
However, once I find the spelling mistakes and start correcting them, I think it
would also be very logical that the AutoComplete words database is updated to
reflect this correction. I think it's a safe assumption that if you correct a
word, it must mean something's 'wrong with it' and the words database must be
'fixed' too, or am I not correct? Probably this wouldn't be very important if I
used the automatic spell checker but I simply hate spell checkers (they work
pretty well in English, but in Danish it's another story (we don't split nouns -
e.g. 'gasoline pumping station' in correct Danish syntax would be
'gasolinepumpingstation', and that seems to freak out spell checkers all the

"NB: This might be a 'framework' issue, as styles exist in all document types  I really, really, like the product.  But I am concerned that it is, in some ways, hidebound by being too much like existing products, which means it is shadowing the  mistakes as well as the good ideas of older products like Wordstar, WordPerfect, Word, etc.  In particular, I am concerned (see late comment in issue 40885) about the logical structure of documents.  Imagine a novel, or a report.  It consists of a hierarchy: Document    - Sections (Frontispiece, Introduction, TOC, chapters, appendicies, indexes).     - Chapters contain paragraphs, illustrations, diagrams, figures .      - paragraphs contain sentences, inserts (foot & endnotes, asides).         - sentences contain words, punctuation, separators.           - words contain characters, numbers, co-joiners . The style heirarchy we have consists of pages, paragraphs (which contain page breaks!), characters.  You will notice that 'pages' do not appear above, not 'chapters' and 'sentences' in the list here..  Word Processing, as distinct from text editing, is a technique in which document production is automated.  The use of styles is an abstraction which encapsulates the attributes intended to perform that automation.  I am suggesting that the abstraction we have could be radically improved by going back to the natural structure of a document and reconsidering where and how the attributes are best created and belong.  The current 'style' model is essentially flat, so that any particular bit of text has a single set of paragraph attributes.  I am proposing a nesting mechanism, so that italic or other-language sentences could live happily within paragraphs, inheriting page margins but having thier own indents - for example.    This is an expansion on the ideas of Issue 30503 and some of those in issue 40885.  I thought it would be useful to further abstract those ideas.  I suggest that these thoughts could advance word processing radically and produce serious product differentiation, and turn writer from a me-to product to one that leads the pack.","ENHANCEMENT"

"Hello,

When I loaded a document to OpenOffice Writer and wanted to add annotation text
immediately after some words, I found it difficult to easily insert annotation
text with another formatting to multiple positions of the original text.

Suppose the original text is formatted with Times New Roman, Unbold:

    aaa bbb ccc ddd eee fff ggg hhh iii jjj kkk.

And I want to append annotations '123', '456', '789' formatted with Arial Bold
to the words 'bbb', 'ddd', 'fff' in the original text, to make it like this:

    aaa bbb [123] ccc ddd [456] eee fff [789] ggg hhh iii jjj kkk.

Here [ ] means the enclosed text is formatted with Arial Bold, a different
formatting from that of the original text.

In practice I want to annotate for much more words than the above simplified
example. What makes my task difficult is that all WYSIWYG (What You See Is What
You Get) rich text editors (Microsoft Word, OpenOffice Writer, Wordpad, etc.)
apply the formatting of the current selection point as you type. To change the
formatting of the current selection point, you have to do extra clicks or
keyboard shortcuts. And when you move the selection point to another position,
the current formatting automatically changes according to the new position. This
behavior may be useful in general, but I suggest rich text editors to allow a
new formatting mode - that is to say, once you choose a formatting, all
subsequent inputs will use this formatting, regardless where you input. I call
this new mode 'Pen Mode', because it is like choosing a new pen of another
color/size and writing anywhere in the document without having to reset to this
formatting again and again.

I added the following comments to issue 6180 which has now been closed. As 
advised I am raising a new issue.

I've noticed the issue to set the default date format appears quite often in 
the users mailing list.

For example for Australia when I select Insert -> Fields -> Date, I get the 
format DD/MM/YY. 

I would like the ability to set the default date format to DD MMM YYYY or DD 
MMMM YYYY.

This issue is not about changing the date once it is inserted. It is about 
setting the underlying default date format separate from the locale.

Another scenario is where people wish to conform to the YYYY-MM-DD standard 
because this is their organisation's standard, whilst the country standard may 
be MM-DD-YYYY.

The default date can be set in Calc (using templates), but there does not 
appear to be such a feature with Writer.

The ability to set the default date in Writer IMHO is a basic requirement. It 
is not a major issue, just an inconvenience.

"The writer component of OOo 1.1.1 has been found to lack the following. The
problem lies with the spellchecker. 

The Problem
While typing people often mispell a word. Like instead of writing 'us' they
might type 'ua'. The spellcheck does not suggest  the word 'us' which should be
an obvious suggestion, considering that 'a' and 's' are adjacent letters on the
keyboard.

Similarly, mistakess like 'tp' do not offer an obvious suggestion 'to'. Neither
is 'na,e' considered to be 'name'.

There are plenty of such spelling mistakes which are not picked up right. The
spellcheck should offer suggestions like these.

I faced this problem with OOo 1.1.1, but I believe that it would be valid for
all versions for all operating systems.

I consider this to be an enhancement. But a patch might have to be released to
correct this for all versions. So I don't really know what to choose.","ENHANCEMENT"

"Sometimes it is necessary to align the contents of a frame relative to the
bottom of the frame, rather than to the top.  In page layout applications which

bottom' option, where the bottom of the frame is placed where the bottom of the
text needs to appear. As new lines are added to the frame, the text is 'bumped
up' to make room for new lines.  In OpenOffice, the only way to align text or
other objects to some bottom reference point, is to resize or reposition a frame
after its contents have been edited. It would be extremely useful to be able to
set the alignment of a frame to 'bottom' and have its contents automatically
aligned to the base of the frame.  This would be especially useful in templates,
where the size of the paragraphs/images would not be known in advance.","ENHANCEMENT"
"Simple problem, no solution:
I just want to define a Frame style that positions images and assigns them a
fixed width, but with the height calculated automatically from the image's
proportions (aspect ratio).
That's not possible, since for images the 'AutoSize' function is not available
and the 'Keep aspect' is obviously ignored when applying frame styles.

To reproduce
- Create new writer doc.
- Insert a small image (e.g. bigapple.gif from the gallary)
- Check image's 'Keep aspect ratio' to ON.
- Create or edit a frame style to place the object somewhere (e.g. right page
border) and set:
    Width: 4 cm
    Height (at least): 1 cm
    AutoSize: ON
    (P.S. Why is 'Keep aspect ratio always grey?)
- Apply style
Result: Image is rescaled to 4cm width (OK for me) and 1 cm height (wrong!).

So obviously
a) the frame style's AutoSize does not work for images
b) the 'Keep aspect ratio' is ignored as well when applying a frame style to an
image.

Fazit: It's not possible to assign a frame style to an image without having to
manually correct the aspect ratio afterwards.
I consider this an important issue if images are to be placed as marginalia
(with a fixed width) beside the text, but the aspect ratio needs of course to be
correct.

8 he discusses 'conceptual models' the working of the ruler in Microsoft Word.
It looks similar to the ruler used in OOo. The only difference is that Word has
a rectangle just below the 2 triangles which can be used to set the indention
(upper) and the margin. This rectangle can be moved to move both the indention
and the margin. OOo has this functionality when moving the lower triangle.

I have to admit I prefer the way Microsoft did it, having a special element for
moving both. Yet Donald notices some deficiencies of the visual elements used to
present this functionality.

Now I quote:
'The proper graphical design would show an explicit linkage between the
rectangle and both sliders. One way of doing this would be to make the rectangle
extend in length between the two controls: If I move a control, only that part
of the margin is affected, and the rectangle would grow or shrink accordingly.
If I moved the rectangle, it would move in position without changing its length,
thereby reinforcing the conceptual model of the operation. As it is, the
relationship is more difficult to discover and remember than necessary.'

"Most Hebrew is written without vowels. To add vowels, certain markings are added
to the consonants. For example, an underline under as consonant adds the 'a' sound. 
There are certain documents that are written with vowels added, as, for example,
the Hebrew version of the Bible.
Now, if I want to Search a document which has vowels in it, ideally I should be
able to just type in the consonants (given that vowelling is optional - and
often there are are a few different possible ways the vowelling may be done) and
then the Search will do the rest. That is the way MS Word (ugh!) does it.
In OO, though, unless you put in the vowels EXACTLY in the Search string, it
doesn't find the words you're looking for. This makes the Search basically
impossible in such documents.
In short, what I think needs to be done is to have the Search check the document

consonants present.","ENHANCEMENT"

"For everyone coming from MS Word there is one annoying thing. When formatting a
paragraph the units are the same as for the layout measurements (margins etc.).
MS Word uses points (only for spacing paragraphs!) which is much more
convenient. I've been using StarOffice and OpenOffice for 5 years and still use
points for spacing (but never use it for the layout). That's why I know you can
define the value in points when you add 'pt' after the measuement. Don't expect
a normal user (or one switching from MS Word) to know that. Points should be the
default unit for spacing between paragraphs (but never for layout measurements
like margins). It's a serious usability issue. I suggest to get this fixed
before the final release of OO 2.0. 

You could do even better than MS. In MS Word clicking the arrow for spacing
makes the figure jump by 6 which too much for me. 1 is too low. But jumping by 3
points would be best for 98% (or more) of the users (a guess of mine). This
would give you one (small) point in usability against MS Word.

"Dear OOo Panel:

Main Point:  The HTML source generated by the HTML editor uses uppercase tags.  
If you could make them lowercase, i.e. <html> as opposed to <HTML>, it would be 
easier for web designers who want to be XHTML Strict compliant to use OO.  For 
a decent summary of XHTML vs. HTML 4 and the various tags used please see 
http://www.w3schools.com/xhtml/xhtml_reference.asp

Explanation:  I have been using OO for almost a month now.  I am really 
impressed with what I have found here and hope to be able to contribute more in 
the future as my programming skills increase.  Write, Math, and Presentation 
seem to be progressing well and have officially replaced MS Office which is 
still installed on my computer.  I was going to use the HTML editor to generate 
a skeleton for my website but when I viewed the source I found all the tags in 
capital letters.  I understand if you wish to keep the HTML editor as primarily 
HTML 4 compliant, but just changing the tags to lowercase would make it a lot 
easier for people who wish to be XHTML 1.0 compliant.  Other things such as 
attributes in quotations and all tags being ended, i.e. <hr /> versun just 
<hr>, would also be a bonus.  If you could possibly allow for the 3 different 
XHTML DTD (strict, transitional, and frames) that would also be a bonus.  Might 
I also suggest a CSS editor as well?  I doubt any of these should pop to the 
top of the to-do list, but the uppercase to lowercase would be a huge step into 
making the html editor more compatible with this web standard.

Thanks for making such a great product.

"After discussion in the GSL list, I have been asked by Herbert to submit this
proposal and set ft@openoffice.org as the owner of the issue. 
This relates to a discussion under Subject â€œautomatic font switch in Calc and
Impressâ€? in July 2004


Font substitutions.

The present font substitution system does not allow a user to change to his
favorite CTL font and start typing.

When encountering a character identified as CTL, it automatically look for a
present-locale substitution table, and not finding it, switches (I am told) to
the â€œenâ€? substitution table in VCL.xcu, therefore finding a font that is rarely
fit to type the userâ€™s CTL script.

The user experience related to this is:

-The user starts work. He opens OOo writer and selects his favorite font for
his language (say a Khmer moul font, used for headings in Khmer language, this
font would not be in the Khmer substitution table).
-Types his first character. Two things may happen:
oA Khmer locale was active, the font is switched to the first font in the list
(correct script, but not the font he wants to use)
oThe English or another locale was active. OOo changes to Tahoma font and
displays a white square
-The user thinks that he has done something wrong, erases the square and starts
again, with the same result.
-With the white square in the screen, the user changes again to his favorite
font and types his first character again. This time it works. Now he has to:
oGo back one character.
oErase the first character that he wrote (white square).
oGo forward one step. 
oKeep on writing. 

With the current system, in theory even an English speaker would have problems
using his desired font in English.

A user will never understand why the behavior of the word processor, or other
application is different for the first and for the second character that he types.

Principles for this correction

It seems correct that if a user chooses the font that he likes, and it is fit
for the language he is writing on (the code points are in the font), that font
should never be automatically switched by the word processor or any other
application. This is the behavior in other word processors. 

A default substitution font should only be used at start time (before the user
chooses the font) or when the present font does not include the code-points that
are being typed. 

Also, it is desirable that the main substitution font be definable by the user,
superseding the VCL.xcu defined substitution fonts. Modern fonts appear that are
rarely updated in the substitution list, therefore giving the option of using a
modern font is important. This now only happens in the Formatïƒ cell option of
Calc, but it should be OOo-wide. By default, the definable font should be the
first one in the substitution table (the first one that is actually present in
the system).

In other word processors, user selected fonts are not switched unless they are
unfit for the character that has just been typed. If the font is not fit, the
word processor looks for a font that can be used as a substitute. If it finds
it, it switches font (and does not go back to the original one if the user types
in English, unless that font does not have English). As there is no substitution
table, the system decides itself which font to use. I believe is the older (date
of installation) font for that code-point range that is installed.


Preliminary proposal. 

The hearth of the proposal is that a font that has been chosen by the user and
that is fit for the character that has been typed should not be changed to a
default font. Only if a font does not contain a code-point (the first
code-point?), it should be changed.

First, the substitution system should be considered.



In case it does not have it, the code-point will be identified as latin (under
256) or language specific (unicode range). 
If latin, the font will be selected based on the preferences of VCL for the
current locale. 
If special (CJK or CTL), it will identify the locale corresponding to the range
of the character, and look for a replacement font for that locale in 
the VCL.xcu file. 

This could also be improved by allowing the user to define the replacements
fonts, for the current locale in Impress and Writer, in the same way that is
done in Cell formatting in Calc (create a Ooo wide definition). 
In this case, if the code-point typed is not in the font (for CJK and CTL), it
will look for the right locale for that code-point. If the locale of the
code-point is not the current locale, it will look directly for a font for that
locale in VCL.xcu. If the locale of the code-point corresponds with the current
locale, it will use the user-defined CTL or CJK default font (which by default
will be the first font for that locale in VCL.Xcu). 

Do any users normally use CJK and CTL at the same time?  This could be changed
into a unique 'Special' language case. 

Also, what OOo calls Asian Languages, for clarification, should be East-Asian,
and naming the languages would be much more clear, as there are only three (old
vietnamese excluded). Instead of CTL I would talk about Indic, South-east Asian
and other complex scripts, this would help users identify themselves with these
concepts. 

In short: 
- All OOo would allow a user changing default Latin, CJK and CTL fonts. 
- A working font for the first character would never be changed. 
- Selected font depends on locale of code-point, if current locale, look for
user-defined font. 
- Changing names in UI.","FEATURE"

"Hi,

I'll display an example Table.

These colums are separated by tabs so if you cut'n'paste into OO.o1.9.91 from
your email you might need to separate the ExampleX and the number by inserting tabs.

Type    Item
ExampleA    24
ExampleB    21
ExampleC/ExampleD    18
ExampleE    15

If you use Table -> Convert -> Text to Table [Separate Text at 'Tabs'] you will
get a nice two column table sitting perty on the screen.

Now in Word97 and unless I'm totally delusional... previous versions of OO.o I
can convert this table back to text using their 'Table to Text' tools and still
get nicely formatted columns due to a new tab generated by the tool.

When I do this in OO.o1.9.91 I get no tab generated by the tool and the table
reverts back to whatever tabs are set up by the default style.

Hope this helps.  Like I said I just can't remember if OO.o in general handles
the conversion like Word97.  This may just become a feature request if not.

"When creating a document with right/left side pages, empty pages are auto-inserted to cover a right page/right page or left page/left page break.  
The 'blank page' should honour the page layout that would be assigned to the page if it weren't empty, including head and foot sections. 
That way, with a duplex printout, the page layout of the auto-inserted page follows that of the regular pages - a completly empty page (as it is currently implemented) looks awfully like a printing error :-( . 
Steps to reproduce the problem: 
- open a new, empty document. 
- insert two H1 (Überschrift 1) headings. 
- change the H1 template to use page breaks with page layout 'right page”. 
- change the 'right page' template to include a foot section and to have the following page formatted as 'left page”. 
- change the 'left page' template to include a foot section and to have the following page formatted as 'right page”. 
- change the foot section of the documents first page to contain i.e. 'right page footer”. 
- insert a manual page break after the first page (inserts a 'left page'), change the foot section to contain i.e. 'left page footer', then remove the manual page break (this gives you the original two pages, empty but for the headlines and foot sections). 
- change to page view ('Seitenansicht”). 
- you'll see three pages: the first headline/footer, a completely empty page, and the second headline/footer page.

"I have been trying to help someone move from Microsoft Office to OOo and we have
come across this major headache.

On openning a MS office document that has Charts (Graphs) imported or pasted
from Excel are impossible to copy or change.  The ability to select items or the
whole object can be almost impossible to do.

In the two examples that I am submitting, I have tried to copy the files from a
MS Doc (opened in OOo 2.0) file into a different document.  There is no way to
select and copy the image and ensure that it is all there.  The selection
process is poor at best.

Select all won't work as it isn't designed to do this.   See issue 46958.

When I tried to select each item, the selection box would change to cover an
area of items, not the actual selected items.  The section process should either
include all the items within the selection box or inidividually mark each and
every item selected.

To test the selection process, using RGfig5a.odt, try to select one of the lines
to convert.  If you select on one diamond, you end up with a selection block
around the selected diamnond.  While holding CTRL+SHIFT, select a second
diamond.  Then select a triangle or square.  You now have a bigger selection box
that covers a larger area.  Now if you move the selection box, you will find
that only the items selected are moved.  This has the effect of making it almost
impossible to select the whole image that you are attempting to copy.

For what it is worth, MS Office works the same way as OOo and it is still a real
pain in the A**.  Here is one area that OOo can be better than MS Office.

I used to make forms in Paradox for Windows and if you selected multiple items,
each was boxed seperatly.  You knew what was acutually selected.

A drag window to select multiple items would be really help in these situations.

Another option would be a selection to convert the objects into a Drawing file.

initial success the first time I tried it, I went and restructured my entire
document, and only encountered problems the next day when I re-ran the
application, so this hurts more than it would have if I'd been told outright it
wasn't supported behaviour.)

Later testing shows that you can create a new master document ('submaster'), put
a normal document in it, save it, create a second new master document
('supermaster'), put the 'submaster' document in it, and it will work. You then
save and close all documents and re-open 'supermaster', and the included

"Tested on Build: 1.9.79

When a table with more than one row is inserted and the height of its header 
row is adjusted to be more than that of the height of the page, the other rows 
disappear. Also, searching for any text which might have been present in the 
other rows produces a very long cursor outside the boundary of the page.

Steps to reproduce: 
1)Start a new Writer document
2)Insert >> Table-with following selections : Columns:5,Rows:5,Headings-
Checked,Repeat Heading-Checked for The First 1 rows,donâ€™t split table-
Unchecked,Border-Checked.
3)In cell 1x1, type â€œHeadingâ€?.
4)In any other cell not in the first row, type â€œHelloâ€?.
5)Right click on any cell in the first row and Select Row >> Height.
6)In the Row Height dialog, enter the height as â€œ38â€?, click OK.
7)The other cells disappear â€“ this may be acceptable behavior since there is 
no space on a page for any other rows.
8)Now go to the start of the document and bring up the Find dialog (CTRL+F).
9)Search for the text â€œHelloâ€?, click Find, and click close.
10)Using the mouse, scroll down the document.
11)Notice the very long cursor.

13)Notice that the cursor is between two pages and allows typing there, though 
no text can be seen.
14)The cursor stays in the same place on typing or pressing enter, but can be 
moved back inside the table by using the mouse.

Expected behavior:
Writer should not let a user increase the height of the header row beyond the 
height of the page.

Observed behavior:
The height of the header row can be increased beyond the height of the page â€“ 
this results in the other rows becoming invisible and some unconventional

"When you Insert a Special Character, Writer inserts a letter in the chosen font,
move the caret after it and keeps your current writing font. That's great.

When you click just after an inserted special character, the current font

It would be nice if the special character was treated... er... special. Somehow
like an image : if you insert an image, it does not change your current font,
when you later imput text right after it.

I believe this should be the case only for characters inserted using the Insert
Special Character function and not for text typed, changing the font with a
format function (character style, Font, etc.).

I know this is a matter of opinion. But I think that the fact that OOo keeps the
font setting in use at the moment of the Insert Special Character call after
inserting the character asks for this model of behavior. If OOo changed the font

what to achieve :
assume a document that contains, for example, an agreement with appendixes. they 
all must be kept in a single document. appendixes should be numbered separately 
- both page number and page count.

one way to do this could be new fields - 'page number in this style - separate' 
(inserts page number in the current style, restarts page numbering whenever this 
style restarts in a document); 'page number in this style - continuous' (inserts 
page number in the current style, keeps numbering whenever this style reappears)
; 'page count in this style - separate' (inserts page count of current style, 
only current section); 'page count in this style - continuous' (inserts page 
count of current style, counts all pages in a document with this style).

additionally there should be an option in style propertis that would allow to 
exclude pages formatted in that style from total page count.

"Hello,

i found it very unintuitive to create a new frame template with paragraph

connection later.

See also issue 33098 where i filed this as defect, but mro told me that it 
should be filed as enhancement.

I see several solutions:

1. Document that if you want a frame template with paragraph binding, that it 
has to be connected with a certain predefined frame template.

2. Create predefined frame templates with names that suggest that they are 
intended as base for page bound, paragraph bound, character bound, ... frame 
templates.

3. Make the binding type editable for unused templates. 

4. Make the binding type editable for all templates after issuing a warning 
that this will mess up the complete document layout.

5. When a new frame template is created, ask what binding type it should have.

I would prefer solution 3..5, because these are most intuitive.

the picture can not extend beyond the edges of the page.

then imagine you only want the bottom half of the picture at the top of the

Another example would be having a picture with some whitespace around it and you
want to make it as big as possible, but the actual size of the image in the
middle of the whitespace within the image is still too small, so you try to make
the actually image larger than the page, however what is printed is still
smaller, except Writer stops you before you get bigger than the page.

Using a graphics editor to edit the picture before inserting would be a

"When creating numbered or bulletted lists, one usually wants blank space before
and after the list, but not between the items. Automating this using styles
currently involves using three styles, a 'Start', 'Continuation' and 'End' style.

When later on, list items are reordered, styles  move along. Thus the user must
eventually reaply the 'First' style to the new item that comes first, and Apply
the 'Cont' (or 'End') style for the item that was moved from the top to
somewhere in the list.

the previous/following paragraph style is the same, wuold elegantly resolve this

"Hi,  
  
when writing some invoices with OOo writer, I use a template with a

from the row above the inserted one. I've provided a demonstating document 
here: ftp://urpla.net/taxtable.odt.  
  
I know, that I'm able to preformat a template with a certain number of   
items, and delete unneeded lines, but that's not flexible and a bit   
of a hassle, especially, since OOo (1.9.104) forgets the alignment on  
editing the currency formatted Item prize field. Just try my document.  
  
OTOH, if the rows are not enough, one has to go though a lot of steps:  
 - add line  
 - enter count, desc, item prize  
 - set item prize and prize alignment  
 - set item prize and prize format  
 - add count * item prize formula  
 - correct sum formula                    
  
While the first two steps are obvious, the rest isn't IMHO, and is even  
harder to teach to somebody less involved.. 
 
The idea is to provide one item row in the invoice template. Adding rows  
inherits the formula (with adjusted field references), number format, and 
alignment. BTW: alignment: it looks like the vertical alignment isn't 
predictable either..

formatted bibliography retains ghosts of the departed reference. The behaviour 
depends on whether changes are being shown or not, but neither behaviour 
matches what I would expect. 
 
If changes are being shown, the reference appears in the bibliography even 
though it has been deleted. The redlined bibliography entry reference is also 
appropriately formatted. It is as if the reference has not been deleted. 
 
If changes are not being shown, the reference does not appear in the 
bibliography section, but it nonetheless affects numbering of references. 
 
The behaviour that I would expect is that redlined references have no effect 
on the bibliography at all-- they should not appear in the bibliography and 
should not affect the numbering of other elements. An alternative that would 
also make sense would be for redlined references to appear in the bibliography 
as redlined text, but still not affect the numbering of other elements. This 
latter behaviour would allow multiple people working on a document to see the 
reference which had previously been a part of the document without affecting 
the final output.

"This is a RFE for OpenOffice version 3: I hope it's not either too early or too
late! I have three suggestions for usability changes to the Navigator. I think
that each of them should be easy to implement, and each would make Navigator
more efficient in its use of space on screen. 

The Navigator is terrifically useful part of OpenOffice: it allows one to see
the structure of complex documents at a glance, and move sections around very
easily. But at the moment it uses up more screen space than is necessary, which
means that one is forced to choose between having it open and docked the whole
time, but having an inadequate amount of space for one's main text; or opening
it only when one really needs it, but having the text larger. I don't think the
user should have to make this choice!

Here are three suggestions to improve its use of screen space.

(1) Make the placement of the icons on the Navigator more intelligent. At the
moment, the icons remain in two rows, even when the Navigator is docked to the
top, and is the full width of the screen. Could I suggest that, when the
Navigator is wide enough, the icons should rearrange to form a single row? 

(2) When you are in 'Content View', don't indent the level one content. 
At the moment, if I'm on 'content view', looking at headings, then the Navigator
looks as follows:  'Headings [-]', is at the top, and is flush with the left
hand edge of the Navigator. However, the actual Headings below this are all
indented by about a centimetre relative to this. As far as I can see, this is
just a waste of screen space. Why not have Heading 1 start flush with the edge
of the Navigator? 
Doing this would allow an extra word of each heading to be shown in Content View
without increasing the screen space used.  (Of course you'll want to continue to
indent heading levels 2, and 3 relative to the level 1 headings. And there's a
good reason to continue to indent in the current way when one is *not* in
content view.). 

(3) Consider removing the bar at the bottom of the Navigator which allows you to
select which document you want to navigate: I don't see that this is very useful
in the ordinary course of events; and it takes up valuable screen space
(especially when the Navigator is docked to the top). Perhaps this feature is
only useful when dealing with Master Documents. It strikes me that it  would be
more intuitive to just assume that the user wants to navigate the document that
has the current focus.

"There seems to be a fundamental problem with creating good-looking long, complex
living documents that contain tables/graphics.

(By 'living document', I mean one that has text added/deleted on a routine basis.)

If one has, for example, a graphic that takes up, say, 75% of a page, there
seems to be no way to tell OOo to behave as follows:

'If the anchor point for the graphic is less than 25% into the page, insert the
graphic in place; otherwise, move the graphic to the next page AND BRING THE
TEXT THAT FOLLOWS THE GRAPHIC FORWARD, SO THAT THERE IS NO BIG GAP OF VERTICAL
WHITE SPACE ON THE CURRENT PAGE'.

In LaTeX, one does this sort of thing with a construct such as the following:

\begin{figure}[ht]
 <commands to insert figure go here>
\end{figure}

Without this capability, then every time that one adds/deletes text, then one
faces the possibility that large vertical white spaces may be created elsewhere
in the document as graphics are moved on to different pages, because OOo never
allows the text that follows the graphic to be pulled forward to fill up the
white space.

(All of the above follows for tables, too, and possibly for other types of object.)

It is, of course, possible to make any given snapshot of the document look good,
by manually moving things around. But as soon as someone changes the amount of
text, then one has to go through the entire document moving tables/graphics
around to make it look good again. This is an unrealistic amount of work to
maintain the visual quality of a large-ish document that contains many graphics
and tables.

(I apologise for wasting your time if this capability is already present; I
spent quite a bit of time and couldn't figure out how to make OOo do this, and
the consensus on ooforum is that it cannot be done.)","ENHANCEMENT"
"I ran into an issue with the saving of a doc with an embedded spreadsheet that
turned out to be fixed by a Microsoft Load/Save option.  Seems crazy to me to
default keeping the SS in OO format when chosing to save the text editor portion
as Word 98.  But Andre came up with a case in which it might make sense.  But
his case was so different that those users would want a whole lot of defaults
set differently than what I'd want.  And no one like installing a program and
having to then go through pages of config options to set up what would seem to
be a normal config.  And the config options are certainly not expansively
documented to allow the user to have a high degree of confidence that they know
exactly what the option is going to do.  I had no idea that an option regarding
the handling of 'OLE objects' was relevant to a spreadsheet in a swriter doc
being saved as a Word 98 doc.

Thus, I think it would be so much kinder if OO had some generalized profiles
such as 'OO working with MS Office users' or 'OO working with other OO users'
and so on that would allow an user in one step to configure OO to behave that
makes the most sense for at least that part of their situation.

Also, many people say they liked some particular version of some program.  If OO
had the ability to select profiles that then set numerous options then OO could
then easily be configured to be more like WordPerfect or Word 6 instead of being
something mentioned in passing in some comment somewhere that OO is so flexible
that it can be configured to behave pretty close to some other word processor.","ENHANCEMENT"

Background of the whish:
Having that pissibility I could set the sections of the globaldocument on
'writable', do all changements directly in the globaldocument and than overwrite
the linked docs with the sections of the globaldocument.
I used to work in a simular way with Lotus WordPro. A globaldocument in Lotus

to save also the linked documents, what I could accept or refuse. By accepting
all changes that had been done in the masterdocument where written to the
source-documents.
When you have for example a catalog or a manual that has to be updated every now
and then, usually you have to change various documents. It is much more
confortable, if you can do that directly in one document, may be a
globaldocument or a writer-document with linked sections.
I'm not sure, what would be the better way to include such a function, if by the
possibility of 'save section as new document/save section-changements to

globaldocument, perhaps your specialists have also better ideas.

Bottom of the frame will be positioned on the base line; thus the frame will be
above the base line.  And when it looks like this:

"I'll describe this as an 'enhancement' because I'm not describing a current
feature not working, though I think it's really a defect, due to the broken
behaviour described later.

There should be somewhere in OpenOffice.org to:

1) See what template a document is associated with, and
2) Change what template a document is associated with.

Changing the template should reload the styles, just as if one had edited the
current template, reloaded the document and clicked 'Yes' (to the question about
updating styles).

Note that this would fix the following somewhat broken behaviour:

- Make a new document based on some template and save it. If you don't have any
templates you'll need to make one first.

- Change the template in some way and save it.

- Close and re-open the document.

- Answer 'No' to the question about updating styles.

Your document is now disociated from the template. There is no way to
re-associate it. You would be able to fix this, of course, if you could just
access the document's template settings and 'switch' back to the old template
again...

One can work around this by creating a new document linked with the template and
copying all the material from the original into it, but that's plain ugly.

Solution:
Make two paste functions for pasting from Calc - one for pasting as table and 
one for pasting as embedded spreadsheet. Or you simply ask the user how with 
three buttons named 'Paste as table', 'Embed as one Spreadsheet' and 'Embed as 
spreadsheet allow splittng'. This makes it possible to paste the rows as a table 
without scaling it and with the ability to edit it like text (e.g. search and

The items could be added directly to the View menu, or perhaps into a context

A viewing style would be a preset combination of zoom, background color, and
font color. Could include other viewing characteristics like window
size/shape/position/color.  Could include a 'view font' which shows all text (or
maybe just all default style text) using a different font and font size, just to
make it more visible. Could include a centralized LUT style screen brightness
and contrast tool in the menu (since my laptop brightness control does not go
dark enough I use xbrightness).

This function would make OO more accessible, for example you could have a big
fat font for people with bad eyesight.  You could with a single mouse operation
change the way a document is displayed (without changing its actual font) to
make it higher contrast or easier on the eyes, or for your mood (it's
Christmas). A function key binding option would be nice. The main reason for me
is to make it so it doesn't hurt my eyes in the morning or at night.

How far could you take this? Welll.. with a function key binding you could
immediately render everything invisible (white text on white) or heck even with
OpenGL and a nice graphics card show it animated like in the preface to Star
Wars. I don't think I need to have a spectrum analyzer graph for my MP3 to run
through the text but you could do that, if you didn't have a tendency to get
seasick.

There are undoubtedly lots of things you could do with this but I think
generally the idea of at least one more view, which provides a magnification and

"Hi,

I've got a huge 700 page document (that I cannot give you).  When copying and
pasting a single sentence into it, OO Writer is very slow.  The paste operation
completes immediately, but then OO Writer becomes 'hangy' for a while, then
editing can continue.  It is as if a background check is started after the
paste, which then makes OO Writer very annoyingly non-reacting for about 15
seconds after which OO Writer then again runs perfectly smoothly.  This may be
due to AutoCorrect being run on the entire document, whenever something is
pasted, rather than just the text pasted into the document.  It has been my
experience that pasting into an OO Writer document gets slower and slower the
larger the document gets.  

Couldn't you somehow limit the part of the document that needs to be rescanned?
 Perhaps the current page, perhaps the last chapter (there's no chapters in my
document, which is simply my diary, so that wouldn't help me).

Apart from this 'lagginess' on paste operations, OO Writer works really well
with large documents.

relative column widths can be specified using '2*' and '3*' instead of 
'40*' and '60*', but small numbers like that result in all columns 
appearing to be the same width. 
 
Because the 'percentage-like' ratios work and the very same ratios 
specified using 'non-percentage-like' values do not work, I suspect that 
the relative column widths are being interpreted as percentages instead 
of arbitrary ratios. This does not conform to the Open Document 1.0 
specification (section 15.9.1 'Column Width') that shows how the widths 
should be calculated from the proportional values (the same way as 
DocBook does it, which it why the transformation should be so convenient 
and why I noticed that there was a problem). 
 
I tried to find the source code that does this calculation but got 
completely lost and couldn't find anything at all--I didn't even know 
which CVS repository might contain the code--so, I can't confirm that 
the reason for the problem is what I suspect it might be. Does anyone 
know where that code might be?","ENHANCEMENT"

"I am running Writer on 1.1.3 on Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2.

To replicate the 'problem':
1.  Open a new Writer document.
2.  Type random text.  
3.  Cut and paste(or type) until it is a page long.
4.  Save it in OpenOffice format.
5.  Create a version.
6.  Note the size of the file.
7.  Change a letter.
8.  Save.
9.  Create a new version.
10.  Note the increase of about 5 Kb.

The reason for this is simple, and I am aware of it.  The versioning method in 
Writer is nothing more or less than saving separate copies with comments 
available.  No 'wave' incrementing is used at all.  This technique saves only 
the changes, in a way that allows the document to be accessed at any point 
along its versioning.  This method does not save entire copies.  Therefore, in 
the example used, much less space would be added for the character change.  
While I realize this is a foolish example, it holds when larger documents are 
modified.  I realize this is a significant project, and that is why I have 
given it a low priority.  However, this could greatly increase the usability of

This doesn't reset the numbering. [even ctrl + shift + space doesn't work here]

As the styles are classified into paragraph/character/numbering styles, it could
be supported that picking the default style from the paragraph section should
not remove the numbering.  But generally a numbering is a modification to the
paragraph also; it changes the indent by default.  

So IMHO, 'default' style (paragraph) should be the rawest type of formatting

"There are some options activated in the auto correction that doesn't really make
sense.
a) beginning a sentence with a capital letter: This annoys most German users
especially as one has to take off this feature regularly again as it seems to be
saved with the document and not with the OpenOffice-Options.
Reason: The German language has very long words and in nearly all business and
scientific words you regularly find abbreviations u.s.w./bzw./M.f.G./z.B. and so
on. There is such a variety of abbreviations and sometimes the abbreviation is
just a typical syllable of a long word that just cannot be on the ignore-list of
OpenOffice. 
When entering words in fields of a table you also always get a capitalized word
though you nearly don't have real sentences in fields of a table. Say you have a
typical headline of a table and insert 'relativ' and 'absolut' you'll get an
autocorrection.
In the German language all substansives are written with a capital letter and
when one is entering a text, one is specially concentrated on where to set
capital letters anyway. 
I think there is no real need for this option in German.
Couldn't we just set this feature to 'off' for default in the German package?

b) same as a) with German words with more than one capital letter. There is an
ignore-list but it doesn't help a lot. Especially in Chart and Graph when one
uses a lot of abbreviations of the form MSinteger, HGewicht, BMedium and so

overlapping spacing would be applied only if the preceding or following style
had no overlapping spacing.  If both adjacent styles had overlapping spacing,
then  they should err.. overlap.

Another alterantive would be for each paragraph manually re-spaced to remember
the setting as a delta to the style ('style spacing -3 point' for example)
rather than a fixed setting.  This would allow proportionate response to a style
change.  But I prefer the 'overlapping' concept, as this would mean I would have
to do no manual adjustment when headings followed headings","ENHANCEMENT"

"At the moment, character styles can be defined to inherit attributes from other 
ones but this must be done explicitly. This proposal is to allow character 
styles that will inherit all attributes from the surrounding text, unless these 
are exoplicitly changed: that's the the way that styles work in the CSS model.

Cascading character styles would be especially useful in multi-lingual 
documents. Since the language of a word is, in OOo, an attribute of its 
characters, we want a quick way to make certain sections as being in language 
'A' and others in language 'B'. This can be kludged with paragraph styles, but 
since the distinction between languages is orthogonal to the kind of 
distinctions that paragraph styles are meant to mark, each paragraph style has 
to be replicated in all the document languages. So a document using three 
langauges and four heading levels needs fifteen different styles defined, ten of 
which differ from others by only their language. This is a lot of work and very 
fragile in collaborative environments. 

If 'language' were defined as a cascading character style, it would be possible 
not just to mark up sections of the document quickly and easily with it, which 
can be done through the character formatting menu already, but to change the 
font or display of text in any language just as is possible with proeper styles 
now.

"US LAWYERS/ATTORNEYS NEED:  Big & Little Caps & Initial Caps.

Your US lawyers (attorneys) and all writers of legal
documents that will be filed in federal, state, and local
courts MUST HAVE the following additions to 'Case:'

Small Caps  (NOT 'ALL CAPS')
        (sometimes referred to incorrectly as 'Big & Little Caps')

Initial Caps

These two additional case choices need to appear
on the OOo Writer context menu just below the
presently included Upper Case and Lower Case font
styles/choices.

REASON:In the US, courts require documents typed to
specification, particularly as to legal citation of
suthorities format.  The formatting system for legal
documents is contained in a book entitled 'A
Uniform System of Citation.'  This book is commonly
referred to among lawyers as 'The Blue Book.'

For legal citations to certain types of controlling
authority, such as treatises and local statutory codes,
Small Cap and Intial Cap formatting is REQUIRED.  If the
formatting is not adhered to, the court filing will be
rejected out of hand.

Please include Small Caps and Initial Caps in your very
earliest 'Patch.'  Until we have those two case formattings,
I'm afraid, we will be unable to use OOo to produce our
legal documents.  'Legal documents,' for lawyers generally
includes any and all letters that lawyers write that make
references to citations of legal authority.

Lawyers/Attorneys are generally the largest descrete
user base for word processors that contain the capability
to produce court compliant legal documents.

It is our understanding that there are other countries
whose legal systems also require the use of Small Caps
and Initial Caps on a regular basis; in addition, most
US government document work also requires these two cases
on a regular basis.

Point of Clarification:     There seems to be some confusion among
the folks who have previously raised this issue as to what a 'small
cap' case is -- we note that one of the previous commentors seemed
to not know the difference between 'Small Caps' and 'ALL CAPS in
a smaller font.'

An example of 'Small Caps' is as follows:

     The word

      The 'T' is capitalized and appears in capital case.
      The 'h' is capitalized but is of the same height  as the lower case.
      The 'e' is capitalized but is of the same height  as the lower case.

      The 'W' is capitalized and appears in capital case.
      The 'o' is capitalized but is of the same height  as the lower case.
      The 'r' is capitalized but is of the same height  as the lower case.
      The 'd' is capitalized but is of the same height  as the lower case.

The printer's marks that one uses to designate small caps to the printer,
if the small caps are not already present in the OOo document would be
'The word' with a double underline beneath it.

'Initial Caps' would be a title or caption on a court document, governed
by a style or 'code' as follows:

     This Is a Title Caption Appearing on Appellant's Responsive
     Law Brief to The Appellee's Motion to Dismiss Filed on 10/05/05

"Hello developers,

Instead of me selection words and heading over to Firefox, it would be great if

add my browser of preference being Firefox and the arguments, being the URL I'd

the argument variable with the words I selected when right-clicking, then viola
I'm searching the web or the web dictionary or web Thesaurus from within writer.

(see rejected bug http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=57531 for

recreate:
create an odt document with several pages. 
make sure that styles Heading1 and Heading2 have no numbering style.
modify (para style) Heading1 to start on a fresh page. ( probably irrelevant,
but... )
modify (list style) Numbering1 to be: before=' Chapter '  after='  '
numbering='1,2,3'  level='1-10'
modify Numbering2 to be: before=' Appendix ' after='  ' numbering='A,B,C'
level='1-10'

then

assign Heading1 to 6 or 8 lines through the doc.
for the first 4 or so, assign Numbering1
for the rest assign Numbering2

now

in Navigator you should see correct chapter and appendix numbering.

now try

changing the scheme as if you were editing and changing your mind about where
chapters start and how many there are. NOTE: you must use
format-bullets&num-remove as well as changing the para style to change the
scheme of chapters and appendices.

What I found:
The A,B,C numbering re-ordered itself correctly on additions, deletions, and
moves. The 1,2,3 numbering ( in Numbering1 ) did not. I got Chap1 - Chap3
-Chap4, or Chap1 - Chap1

"Well, I know kerning is a font issue, but the currently behaviour is weird for
non english typers. Read bellow

Currently:
Kerning pairs are used correctly (if the user marks this option) and OOo uses
the data in font files. Then, for example, the pair 'Te' is kerned ok.
But if you type in Spanish (or most European languages), the pair 'Té' is not
kerned, because there is no info in font data about 'Té' pair. But the 'é' char
is very similar to 'e' char, so 'Te' and 'Té' should be kerned the same way.
This behaviour is caused by font makers, since they don't include accented chars
(and other chars like ñ) in their kerning pairs.

Objective: 
To manage some non-kerning pairs as kerning pairs.

Alternative one:
Modify all the font files on the user's system to add some kerning pairs!

Alternative two, better, IMHO:
In OOo, define tables of new kerning pairs based on existing font kernig pairs.
This tables could be font dependent ones, user dependent ones and/or language
dependent ones.

"Logically, when tables are nested, they form an outline. It should be possible
to see this outline in the Navigator (just like the 'Headings' outline). 

But the navigator shows all tables in a flat list.

It is clear that tables are SUPPOSED to form an outline. This is evident from
the fact that right-clicking on 'tables' list in the Navigator allows us to
select how many outline levels to display. But this control does not have any
effect on the actual display.

"The Navigator is SUPPOSED to serve as a MAP of the document. But it has a major
limitation: A map is useful only if you know your current location in the map.
But the Navigator does not tell you where you are at present. 

Compare this with the 'Style and Formatting' window, which always highlights the
current style. Likewise, the Navigator must highlight the current item (i.e.,
table, heading, figure, frame, etc.)

Note that the user can make sense of only the 'Heading' entries in the
Navigator, because he can read the actual text of the headings in the Navigator
box. But all other items (e.g. Tables) are identified by number, which makes no
sense to him. So he can't use the Navigator alone to identify which table he
wants to jump to.

For example, suppose your document has  a lot of tables and it is your intention
is to navigate through these tables. In that case, the Navigator will show a
long list of tables, but will not tell you which table you are at. The only way
you can identify your current table is to look up its number from the status
line; and then to look up that number in the Navigator's 'Tables' list. 

Locating a table number in the Navigator is not easy, because the list is not in
ascending order; and many numbers may be missing (if you had deleted some tables
in the document). Worse, you cannot renumber the tables.

The same problem also applies to all other items (e.g. images).

So, like the 'Styles and Formatting' window, synchronize the Navigator also with
the document.","ENHANCEMENT"

However, some languages, at least Thai, don't have the concept of p and pp. In

To make alphabetical index for such languages, one must disable 'Combine

Currently, conditional text is entered into a single-line text field in a dialog

as much conditional text as exists in the text field (not text area), and (3)
place text with arbitrary conditions in quotation marks to keep it from
mysteriously disappearing.  Conditional text also cannot contain anything
'interesting'--no graphics or other objects, and not even formatting tags.

The actual file format implements conditional text using a simple surrounding
tag, and so it seems that the most approachable way to handle conditional text
would be to provide a formatting button like Bold or Italics that instead says
'Conditional...' (perhaps with a question mark for an icon) and on selection

places in the GUI:

2. Status Bar (Displays only when you are inside any table)
3. Caption (Displays only when you have opted to show captions for tables)

Problem: 
The table number in the first two places (in the list above) is different from
the table number in the third place. Despite being different, both numbers are
expressed in identical format ('Table n'). This is confusing for the writer and
reader.

>> The table number embedded in the caption is given in top-down order. The
numbering is DYNAMIC: When the original order of the tables is disturbed (e.g.
tables are inserted, deleted or moved in the document), the concerned tables are
renumbered automatically.

>> In contrast, the table number displayed in the Status Bar and Navigator
reflects the order in which the tables were CREATED. The numbering is STATIC:
The number allotted to a given table does not change when tables are inserted,
deleted or moved in the document.

Suggestion to eliminate the confusion: 
Either use the same number at all places, or use separate nomenclature to
distinguish between these two numbers.

****
Additional notes:

1. Numbering of nested tables is difficult. Particularly, if the document uses a
two-column table to control its text-flow (i.e., left column is the left margin
and the right column holds the text). In this case, all the 'normal' tables in
the document are actually at Level-2. Uniform numbering of such tables is difficult.

2. Numbering the tables in the order of their creation is not meaningful;
particularly if the document is large. Even the original author will not
remember a table by its birth sequence. For the reader, it makes absolutely no
sense ('Go to the table that was created 53rd in this document'). 

3. The number used in the caption is a field, which is automatically updated.
This can be used inside the text to cross-refer to any table. When any table is
renumbered, the cross-references are also updated; so the link is never broken.
So, if the Navigator needs a unique identifier for each table, why not use the
same number that is used in its caption?","ENHANCEMENT"

Perhaps there could be a desktop publishing mode and a word processing mode.

"Side by side, with Microsoft Office, the OO user interface for doing text
rotation is so clumsy and ineptly designed as to be nearly useless.  Please let
me explain:

In MS office, you just tell it 'rotate text' (in a top-level menu item, if I
remember correctly) and you're done. 

In OO, it's buried do deeply in menus so you can hardly find it.  Then, once you
do, it doesn't really work.

The character rotation doesn't work, because it doesn't respect newlines.  You
have to use manual break instead, which is really tedious because OO (unlike MS
office) doesn't provide a hot key to insert a manual line break.  (yes, you can
set up a hot key for the dialog, but then you still have to select 'line break'
-- it doesn't remember your last choice -- and hit enter.  Very boring)

If one can be content with 270 degree rotation, one can select 'table
properties' (deceptively named, since what you're really adjusting is the table
CELL properties) and change text flow/text direction, which works the way the
'character / properties' OUGHT to work.

I am sure there is some fancy-pants XML/object-oriented philosophical reason for
doing thing this way, but from the standpoint of user experience, it sucks.","FEATURE"

"For a multi-page table, insert continuation indicators on each page.

Sometimes a file can contain multiple long tables, each spanning over =>2 pages.
These tables may have identical structure. A typical example is a User's Manual
of an application, which has identically structured tables that explain
different menus.

When the reader sees pages after pages of identically strutured tables, it is
very difficult for him to distinguish between these tables. So there must be a
provision to indicate when one table ends and when another begins.

Secondly, the caption of a multi-page table appears only once; not on each page.
So if the user sees a middle piece of the table, he can't tell which table it
is. He has to scroll down till the end of the table (or scroll up till the top)
to check the caption. Ideally, he should be able to glance at the top/bottom of
the current page and tell which table this is.

For better readability, the following should be provided:
1. Wherever the table breaks over a page-break, Writer should automatically
insert a right-aligned 'To be continued on next page...' sentence. (Provide a
default sentence, but also let the author edit the sentence.)

2. Writer should automatically repeat the table's caption on each page.
(Typically, this would include the table number and a title).

3. On the next page, where the table continues, Writer should insert a
left-aligned '(...Continued from the previous page)' sentence to indicate that
this part of the table is in continuation. (Provide a default sentence, but also
let the author edit the sentence.)

Note that the author cannot insert these sentences manually, because the
location of the table-break point keeps shifting as the file is edited.","ENHANCEMENT"
"OOo has several windows like 'Style & Formatting' and Navigation window, which

Instead, provide 'type-ahead' to locate the desired entry quickly.

Note: I am not sure of the term-- Probably this feature is described as
'incremental search' or 'predictive entry'

What I mean is, if I enter 'h', the highlight should jump to an entry that
begins with 'H'. If I enter more letters quickly, Writer should try to match the
entire string and find a suitable entry. For example, when I type 'he', the
highlight should jump to an entry that begins with 'he' (say, 'Heading1'), and
so on.

Column formatting instead of following the section formatting into which they're

"Background:

Date fields (not fixed date fields) currently update to the current date as soon
as you open the document.  In my experience, these fields are typically used to
record the date of the document, meaning the date it was last updated, and are
used so the author doesn't have to remember to manually change the date.  

Issues:

-1- you can't open a document to find out when it was last edited (and, if it is
the version you want) because the date changes as soon as you open it, and

-2- if you open the document to print it, the printout has the date the doc was
printed instead of the date it was written.

Possible solutions:

-1- do not update date field values until the 'dirty' flag is set indicating the
document has been modified, i.e. change the date value when you ungrey the Save
button.  

-2- push the date value change onto the undo stack so that if you undo your
changes back to the point where the save button is grey again, the date is restored.

-3- if enough people like the current behaviour, a new field type can be added
with the proposed behavior, perhaps called 'date modified'.  personally, I think
the change should be made directly to the date field.","ENHANCEMENT"

Pasted As           Result in *.txt file

This is, of course, ludicrous. There is no reason that a plain text file cannot

'Paste Special Text' does not, in fact, paste the data as plain text into the file.

it does this very well indeed. You just have to use a program that actually
sends the information to the printer properly.

italic characters, for example). But it /would/ be nice if OpenOffice could
actually export text properly.

apart. But it does not allow the author to insert page numbers for this

Look at it from another angle: 
The context menu of any object should be about something MORE specific about
that object. For example, 
> A specific property of the object (e.g. 'alignment')
> All properties of the object (the 'Properties...' command)
> A specific PART of the object (e.g. 'caption')

than attaching the new description in that issue, I am opening a new issue.
******

The attached document demonstrates problems with 'Keep with the next paragraph'
property of a paragraph.

In the document, I have done the following preparatory work:
1.Created three paragraphs named para1, para2 and para3.
2.selected Keep with the next paragraph for para1 only. The other two paragraphs
are normal.
3.I have entered blank lines below this description to position the paragraphs
near the page-break.


Experiments:
1.If we click in the blank space below the horizontal ruler and insert/delete
lines (by pressing Enter and Delete, respectively), the para1 stays with para2
(this is OK). 

2.But if we click on the left of para1 and press Enter, its Keep with the next
paragraph attribute gets reset. (This is a defect, because a paragraph's
properties should not change when we press Enter at its beginning.)

3.In fact, there is another (related) defect: If we split para1 (by clicking
anywhere in it and pressing Enter), the Keep with the next paragraph attribute
of the second part gets reset. This is totally illogical: In our original
scheme, para1 was supposed to stay with para2. If para1 is split, both split
parts now stay together, and para2 is abandoned!
   
Compared to that, any of the following arrangements would be more logical:
a)Both parts of Para1 have the Keep with the next paragraph attribute selected,
(in other words, both parts of para1 stay with para2.)
b)Only the second part of para1 has the Keep with the next paragraph attribute
selected, (In other words, only the second part of para1 stays with para2.)

But it is difficult to move images and anchor them to paragraphs in a NESTED

fashion. The problem is severe when the paragraph is in a right-side column of
the nested table.

In some cases, when the image has to be dragged across multiple pages, it jumps

would be taken from the character to the right of the new position of the
cursor.  If the user was moving the cursor to the right, the format would be
taken from the character to the left of the new position.  In other words,
always take the format from the character you just lept over.  (Don't mishandle
the case where what you just lept over was not a character but rather an image,

I considered listing this as just an enhancement, but the current behavior makes
writing certain kinds of documents (such as ones containing many mathematical
symbols, superscripts, emphasis, etc.) incredibly laborious.  Although the
workaround is simple enough, the workaround has to be employed so frequently
that I feel it deserves serious attention.  People do mostly typing in a word
processor, and this is a typing-related issue.  Making this feature enhancement
would improve user-friendliness by leaps and bounds.

To illustrate my point, consider this piece of text:
   aL|a
Here, | represents the cursor, and L is in a different format from either of the
a's.  I would like to insert a space between L and the second a.  Manually
changing the format before typing isn't always a reasonable option, because the
format may be very complex (e.g., the font, bold, italics, and superscript were
all set manually), requiring unreasonable effort.  What I end up doing is moving
to the right of a, inserting a space and another a, and then deleting the a to
the left of the space.  While that sounds simple enough, you should try doing it
over and over again.  Not only does it require unnecessary extra steps, but it's
incredibly distracting from the task at hand, which is the composition of a

"In TOC, link to a non-existent item  is not handled properly

A TOC with hyperlinks can point to a non-existent item when-

When the user clicks on such an entry in TOC, Writer jumps a couple of lines
downwards. There is no other response, such as an error message appearing in a

OOo should handle both kinds of error with more user-friendliness.

Suggestions: 
Provide a window with-
1. The error message
2. Option to jump to the location (to re-create the missing heading or to
reapply 'heading' style)
3. Option to remove the entry from TOC,

Note that although the target of the hyperlink is missing now, the TOC still has
the (old) page number. This information can be used to jump to an approximate
location where the target was located last. (Of course, if the document is
edited heavily, page numbers in TOC would be wrong; but this facility will help

Benefits deriving from providing such functionality (again, IMO):

* Separation of content and layout

This is something we've been talking about for years in the WWW, but strangely
the concept does not seem to have hit the desktop-publishing very mutch yet.

* Oo proselytism

The scientific/academic community would for sure like (and use) such a feature

It could be that a few companies could adopt Oo solely for the ease a text-only

"When tracking and showing (Edit -> Changes -> Show enabled) changes in Writer,
it is not possible to hide the deleted (or added) parts. Could this feature be
added?

I'm doing this all the time with MS Office as it's very useful to print a
version with change bars only (and possibly a specific color/style for
additions) but without the removed items. The resulting document is very
readable and useful whereas having also the removed parts too often result in a
very cluttered document.
Being able to only view the deletions (= previous version, with removed parts in
a different style) may be useful but to be frank I've never used it.

This could be achieved by adding a 'hidden' attribute in the Changes options
dialog (Tools -> Options, the OpenOffice.org Writer -> Changes) for deletions
and insertions. The MS Office way is to interpret 'No attribute' for deletion as
'hidden', but it's not very logical IMHO. Still ok for my use thought I you
prefer it.

"Navigator should also list all Index Entries.
 
Currently the user cannot directly jump to any Index Entry, because of the

1. The Index Entry dialog is designed for sequential access
>> It does not allow direct access to any desired Index Entry
>> It does not allow any desired occurrence of a given Index Entry

2. Unlike TOC, page numbers in the Indexes are not hyperlinked.

The only way a user can go to a desired Index Entry is this:
1. Look up an Index and check the page number for the desired Index Entry.
2. Enter this page number in the Navigator to jump to that page
3. Activate field shadings and locate the Index Entry on the page.
4. Right-click on the Index Entry to start the dialog with focus on the desired
entry

This has to be repeated for each entry.

Obviously this is too tedious.

As a solution, the Navigator should also list all Index entries. 
User will then be able to browse all Index entries, and jump to any occurrence
of any entry in the document.

"I am hoping a capable person can add a patch to enhance writer and make it more
compatible with the legal profession. There are a number of law professionals
that still use word perfect and MS Office because OpenOffice can't produce the
required line numbering scheme. I think the fix should be simple.

I should note, there are a few macros and templates that people have made to
patch the solution together. They are inconvenient and it would be better to
enhance the line numbering code and remove any reasons an attorney has for not
using openoffice.

In a legal pleading the attorney must submit a document that has strict
formatting requirements as far as the line numbers go. The text itself is single
spaced at the top of the first page and double spaced below. The line numbers
need to be double spaced throughout. Each page is typically numbered 1-23.

The problem, as I recall, is that open office counts the actual lines of text so
the numbering in the single spaced section doesn't fit the courts requirements.

At the moment I'm not sure, what would be a satisfying solution, perhaps someone

When field names are shown in a document, the whole file may have more pages and
the index-entries may move to different pages. When creating or activating an
index while 'field names' are checked in the view-menu, the page numbers of
indexes are based on the field-name-view that usually is not the view in which a
document will be printed or exported to pdf. 

Page preview shows the document without field names and so the page numbers in
indexes within the 'page preview' do not match with the shown content.

One solution could be a message when creating or updating an index, like the
message 'do you want to print the document with field names' when printing, so
that a user gets aware. If he doesn't, he might print a document with indexes
that point to wrong destinations.","ENHANCEMENT"

a) if I change the language setting for the current document to 'English (UK)',

c) If I try to correct the value entering '1.23' the value gets set to '44927'.
To set the value back to '1.23', I have to enter '001.23', which gets reset to
'123' when I reopen the document.

d) when I open the document, change the locale setting from 'default' to

change between single, double, triple, etc. columns directly with only one or
two clicks.  The formatting is based on a simple default.  So, the user may not
be exposed to all of the functionality possible when working with files, but the
average home user simply wants to change column usage quickly and easily.

It is possible to add a 'Columns' button to the standard or formatting toolbars
in OOo, but changing the number of columns is only then accomplished by working
within a separate dialogue window.

This is a case where I appreciate the capability of OOo to accomplish a task,
but I feel that the most common use of the functionality begs for increased
simplicity.  In my mind it would be great if the 'Columns' toolbar button were
changed in such a way that it becomes a drop-down box showing multiple column
arrangements and also includes a button called 'Details' or something along
those lines to allow people to access the separate dialogue box if desired.  The
options in the toolbar button would use the same measurement system as the one
in the dialogue window, but it wouldn't be necessary to open the dialogue window
for simple changes.","ENHANCEMENT"
"for scientific literature that is periodically published in updated editions,
numbers for paragraphs are jused more and more, so that references to a specific
paragraph will be correct in the next edition, too, since not depending on page
numbers.

such numbers are written beside (to the outer side of a page of a book) a
paragraph, either in the middle of it or at its top. It doesn't necessary mean
that each paragraph is counted. Paragraphs which are inserted in a later
edition, e.g. between paragraph 2 and 3, is numbered '2a'.

"When text is entered for which the selected font doesn't have the appropriate
glyphs (in this case from the Greek and Greek Extended character sets), font
substitution is done. However, this sometimes leads to a trailing space at the
end of the line, most noticeable in two circumstances:

(1) when the cursor is at the end of the line: the cursor appears in the wrong place

(2) when the line wraps and the paragraph's alignment is 'justified', the extra
space at the end of the line is especially obvious.

The defect shows up not only in screenshots but in PDFs and printing.

This behaviour shows up regardless of 'Asian typography' paragraph settings, so
I guess issue 57853 is unrelated.

Select the overall frame containing the image  and caption, Ctrl-C to copy, click on another page, then  Ctrl-V to paste. The result is a blizzard of ASCII text  that seems to describe the image and caption, but it's  surely not what happened in previous versions!

2) In spite of that when you invoke the letter wizard, the latter ignores the

"There are a few issues concerning HTML export in Writer:
1. Formatting is sometimes lost during export.
I have a document in which text is generally formatted as 'justify', but there 
are some paragraphs formatted as 'center'. After export, all browsers (IE, 
Opera, Firefox, Netscape) represents these paragraphs as 'justify'. When I 
looked into HTML code, I've found the following string:

<P CLASS='western' ALIGN=CENTER STYLE='font-variant: small-
caps'><B>something</B></P>

But stylesheet contains the following record:

P { direction: ltr; color: #000000; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; 
widows: 2; orphans: 2 }

HTML specification says that style attributes override tag parameters, so the 
above 'ALIGN=CENTER' has no effect.

2. Pictures are resized in a strange way (their real sizes are different from 
WIDTH and HEIGHT parameters of IMG tag). When IE (or Opera, or Firefox) 
shrinks them, they look ugly (these pictures are not photos, but diagrams). 
May be it would be better to resize pictures during export using proper 
interpolation algorithm.

"Rubies dialog is not fully functional.

Japanese language support is on.

User enters text in Japanese, and selects it.

User invokes 'Format/Asian phonetics guide...' from menu.

What's supposed to happen is that the software identifies kanji word stems
('base text') in the selected text, and puts them one to each box in the 'base
text' column of the dialog box, and in the right-hand column, it should insert
the furigana ('ruby text') for each base text item. The user can edit them by
inserting an alternative pronunciation, or by deleting the furigana for some
items.  Then the user clicks 'Apply', and rubies (furigana) are applied to all
the word stems accordingly.

There are several ways in which this doesn't work properly in OOo:

1) Instead of picking up just word stems, it picks up whole words as they appear
in dictionaries, so if you write ????, (ikimasu -- the present or future
tense of 'to go'), it picks up ??, (iki -- the gerund of 'to go'), when it
should pick up ?, (i -- the stem of 'to go'). It leads to incorrect positioning
of furigana. Picking up only word stems shouldn't be hard from the programming
point of view, since they are sequences of kanji characters, and can be
identified by the simple expedient of checking the unicode value of the
characters to see if they are in the range of kanji characters, as opposed to
kana, space, punctuation, or some other (or by using a dictionary subset that
contains only kanji stems, no inflected forms or words spelled in kana).

2) The software doesn't produce the furigana, so the user has to type them all
in by hand. From the way the software picks up words for the 'base text' fields,
it is evident that it is using a dictionary. If that dictionary contains entries
for the pronunciation of each word contained therein, it ought to be a small
matter to look up the pronunciation and insert that into the associated 'ruby
text' field. Sadly, the software doesn't bother, and the user is left with the
tedious job of doing it by hand. In some situations, this could involve looking
up a separate dictionary.

3) The system is completely fooled by punctuation marks. If the user selects an
area of text that includes a comma (?), full-stop (?), or other punctuation
mark, all the rest of the selected area, including the punctuation mark will be
inserted into a single ruby text field. This adds to the tedium of adding
furigana to text, because only one phrase can be handled at a time, rather than
a substantial passage of text being all handled at once with a single invocation
of the dialog.

4) The software ought to remember the furigana entered by the user, so that it
can be automatically used again the next time the pronunciation guide dialog box
is invoked.

If the ruby dialog were fully functional, a user could select a whole page of
text, invoke the phonetics guide once, click 'Apply', and see furigana for all
the words in passage. As it stands now, the user would have to invoke the dialog
dozens of times, and type in the pronunciation for each word by hand, in a
procedure more tedious than it would be to type out the whole passage twice,
once with kanji and once without.","FEATURE"

By keeping the style sheet external to the writer document, it will be much 
more easier to maintain a number of documents (and a master document) using 
the same formatting.

F.i., if one is to write a book, it is very likely that each and every chapter

document.

A template will be created which will contain the base formatting styles used 
for each chapter and used for the master document.
If, however, a new style needs te be added, or an existing style needs to be 
changed (which will happen for sure), all other chapters and the master 
document must reload the styles (if one is to maintain the same look and feel

my case), the current rule seems to be:

- When a space or ambiguous character occurs at the beginning of a paragraph or
after a manual line break, or after another character that is applied the
Western font, the Western font is applied; otherwise (when it occurs after a
character that is applied the Chinese font, say, a normally input Chinese
characters or a ASCII character that is applied the Chinese font) the Asian font
is applied.

This causes headaches in the following scenarios:

1) For a phrase like 'æµ‹è¯•â€œtestâ€?' (whether imported from a Word file or directly
input), the left quote will appear in the Chinese font SimSun, but the right
quote will appear in the Western font Times New Roman.

2) For a phrase like 'æµ‹è¯• test æµ‹è¯•', the first space will be in Chinese font,
and the second will be in Western font.

3) For a phrase like 'æµ‹è¯•â€œæµ‹è¯•â€?', if I insert a manual break before the left
quote, the left quote will be in Western font suddenly.

The rule of Word seems to be simpler. When importing text under a East Asian
enabled environment, all the ambiguous-width characters are applied the East
Asian font, and spaces are always applied the Western font; unless one manually
chooses another font for the text. It seems more reasonable and intuitive.","DEFECT"

In this document, I have inserted a lot of hyperlinks that jump to headings.

The headings do not carry outline numbers. Yet, when I try to insert a hyperlink
in this document, the window shows headings with hierarchical numbers attached
to them.

For example, I have a hyperlink that jumps to a heading 2 titled 'using
bookmarks'. If I hover the mouse over the hyperlinked text, the following
tooltip is shown:

#7.4.Using bookmarks|Outline

(note the period after 7.4; and also the word 'Outline' at the end)

I have not given this 7.4; nor can I actually see this number anywhere except
the hyperlink dialog. Nor is this heading supposed to be part of any outlining.

If it was only this issue, I would have tolerated it as a harmless nuisance. 

But this is far serious: After saving the file, when I reopen it, the hyperlink
is no longer able to jump to the target heading, because the 'outline number' in
the link resets to zero, like this:

#0.0.Using bookmarks|Outline

To correct this, I have to edit the outline and re-insert the number (7.4) in
the place of 0.0

"This enhancement request is perhaps best described by an example:-

Currently as at OOo 2.0.2, when a frame is placed in a page and set to wrap
'through' and background transparency 100%, it applies as expected to the
'underlying' page text. If a new frame is placed within the existing frame, and
it's wrap is set to other than 'through', and transparency 0%, these attributes
are not honoured by the page text. I.e. the 'underlying' page text can still be
seen beneath and flowing through the new opaque frame. The new frame attibutes
are, however, honoured by any text inside the parent frame.

This is a request to extend the application of frame attributes through all
relevant levels of nexting. I.e. in the example above, the page text would flow
through the parent frame and remain visible but would then flow around the inner
frame.

In this particular example, the desired effect could be achieved by not placing
the second frame inside the first. However, the ability to group frames within a
parent frame for other purposes is sometimes required, and this is where the
current limited application of nested frame attributes sometimes conflicts with
layout goals.","ENHANCEMENT"

shown ion the document (or the preview pane). 

There are several aspects that are counterintuitive:
1. The 'LS' has 'internet link' style by default. The presence of 'LS' itself
changes the font style of the rest of the entries to 'hyperlink'; even if their
own font style is 'default'

2. The font style of 'F#' and 'F' entries is '<none>'. Yet in actual document,
they appear as hyperlinks. 

3. Changing the font style of 'F#' and 'F' to 'Default' does not change
anything: The display remains hyperlinked.

4. The font style of 'LF' button is inconsequential altogether, as changing its
style does not affact anything at all!

Thanks for taking the time to look into this.

I am bilingual - English and Japanese.

I love OpenOffice (especially since version 2 was released), but I am having a
problem with Japanese text formatting.

Going to Format (menu), Page, Page tab, allows a user to select text direction -
Left to right (horizontal), or Right to left (vertical).  These same buttons are
available to be put on a toolbar as desired (selecting content from the
formatting toolbar when in the 'Customize Toolbar' dialogue), but are named
slightly differently - 'Text direction from top to bottom' and 'Text direction
from left to right'.  Neither of these buttons, however, works.  (Other users
have verified this problem.)

This is very frustrating, because it is very convenient for formatting
newsletters and whatnot to have these formatting buttons just one click away,
rather than buried within the Format Page dialogue.

I seem to remember that these buttons worked in version 1.9, but I can't
remember exactly.

I think it should be fairly easy to repair the functionality of these buttons.  

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or feedback.

Description:
I've made a Writer document structured with tables (not OLE objects). Tables are
2 columns wide: one for titles, the second for text and pictures.
I've got a few objects in it, some PNG, EPS and some Calc. The document is 20
pages long.

Problem:
When I'm happy with the appearence and content of the file, I save it, close it
and reoppen it later. Then I see that some objects have moved. they sometime go
to the next or previous page despite many attempt of different anchoring.

I frequently have to wait 10 seconds that the object repositionning stop before
beeing able to edit my file (screen blinking, pictures moving, ...). I also have
to replace the moved object to their correct location.
Last times I opened my file, it made OO go 100% CPU. My deduction is that this
picture movement go through some kind of mad loop or else.

I had this very same behaviour on a Windows and on my Gentoo/Linux box, both on

"Especially for Public Administration and for larger companies the current
implementation of forms handling in the broadest sense is not satisfying in
OpenOffice Writer.

There are miscellaneous possibilities for working with forms: input fields,
bookmarks, placeholders or control objects. Bookmarks and placeholders are not
critical, so I will ignore it.
For input fields there are some rfe's in issuezilla yet (see 16641, 33737,
35088, 47799, 50839, 56156). The main points are
- input fields should not pop up when opening the template (because you cannot
see the context)
- should be editable â€œon clickâ€? without prompting
- should be reachable by tab like controls

It should be discussed, if forms handling can be improved much more by using the
possibilities of controls.
A text form field in MS Word can be formatted. For input fields in writer you
don't have such opportunities. This is only one restriction.

If controls could be smoothly integrated into continuous text, I would prefer
this solution of forms handling.
The form than is really a form, you can jump with the tab key from the first to
the last control, you can use all possibilities you got with formatted and
currency fields, masked field etc.

The following must change to reach that goal:

- first an AutoSize option is needed. [1]
- per default the background of controls should be shaded without printing the
background color. If the control gets the focus, the shadowing should be stronger.
- per default there's no need for a border
- by inserting the controls into text, the underlying context must be
recognized, means the char formatting of the control must correspond to the
formatting of the last char of text.
- a property â€œplaceholder textâ€? would be nice, see [1]
- binding the control content to variables without programming [1]
- if controls are inserted into tables, calculating with them must be possible
without programming
for the Rich Text Control, the tab key should work as for other controls
(jumping to the next)
- an option is needed to switch the scroll wheel off for some controls. In
practice the users often overwrite entries in controls accidentally during
scrolling. That's very annoying when these data are used for workflow.

These requirements may collide with the needs of forms in base, but this could
be solved as follows:
If the control was created with a wizard or by drawing with mouse, then the
control gets the properties in the current existing implementation.
Additionally we need another possibility to insert a control. This could be
realized in the menu bar with Insert->Form Field->Type of Field or by
doubleclicking on the icon in the bar â€œforms-control elementsâ€? (transl. from
German) or both.
Then the control is inserted at the viewcursor position in a defined size
dependent from context with the properties described above.

If this could be realized, than the import filter for MS Word should transform
listboxes and text form fields to controls in OpenOffice.

"Currently, when you create or modify a paragraph style, character style or list
style you can change or add 'attributes' to the style. Initially, the text below
'Contains:' in the Organiser tab of the style dialogue is empty or contains only
a few items. As you add 'attributes' the list grows. However, there is no way of
removing those 'attributes' again. Once specified, they remain forever.

Example: I write a document that contains some snippets of source code
interspersed into paragraphs of English prose set in 12pt. I format them using
the character style 'Source Text' and change the fontsize of 'Source Text' to
12pt and the fontstyle to italics. Later on, I find myself using some snippets
of source code in a footnote and again use the character style 'Source Text' to
format them. However, as my footnotes are only 9pt the source code is formatted
to big now. In theory, I have two options now:

- Creating a second character style for source code in footnotes and specify the
fontsize to be 9pt. However, this solution makes only limited sense since my
real intention is to just use the fontsize of the paragraph the text appears in,
that is I really did not want to specify any fontsize in the character style.

- Reverting the specification of the fontsize in the Source Text character style
to 'not specified'. This way the source code would inherent the fontsize from
the paragraph that it appears in.

In practice, I only have the first option as the second is currently not
provided by OpenOffice. In this example, it was indeed a mistake to specify the
fontsize for the character style in the first place. However, there should be
some way of rectifying this. In fact, during the lifecycle of a document it
might have indeed made some sense to specify the fontsize for the character
style at some point (maybe we wanted source code to appear smaller than the rest
of the text) but later the author might have changed his/her mind. Currently,
there is no way of doing this properly as I regard the first option above as
impractical.

The same applies to paragraph styles and list styles and maybe (I haven't really
thought about that enough) to page styles and frame styles. It not only applies
to style attributes being inherited from surrounding text, as in the example
above, but also to style attributes being inherited from a style's parent style.
That is, if the user overrides an attribute in a child style that has been
inherited from its parent style, there should be a way of removing that override
again.

Especially with the introduction of the ODF, a highly structured document
format, the ability to remove specifications from styles is a necessity for
authoring structured documents. Inheritance of styles is a very powerful thing,
but it seems that there is currently one piece missing in the puzzle that would
unfold its full potential.

Therefore, I suggest to add the ability to remove attributes from all kinds of
styles. This could be done with checkboxes next to pretty much all of the
controls in the style dialogues. Initially, those checkboxes would be set to
unticked. Whenever the user specifies an attribute, e.g. the fontsize, the
corresponding checkbox gets automatically ticked. The user has the ability to
untick the checkbox at any time later in the lifecycle of the document, which
could (not sure if it should) disable the corresponding control, e.g. the
fontsize listbox.","ENHANCEMENT"

"Here's the scenario. I'm teaching a class, for which I have prepared material in
the form of a large outline. Each class I select the portion of the outline
which we will cover that day, print it, and hand out copies to my students.

The problem is, when printing a selected portion of an outline, the numbering is
reset (begins with 1, I, or A, depending on how the outline is formatted) on the
output.

For instance, if I had this outline:
1.
  a.
  b.
2.
  a.
  b.
3.
  a.
  b.

... and I selected point 2 and its sub-points, and printed it, the output would
read:
1.
  a.
  b.

2.
  a.
  b.

You can see how this would be confusing to my students, and would make putting
all the handouts together at the end of the course to form the full outline (as
was my intention) impossible, since the order is all messed up.

"The original document was written by an english user on an english OOo platform.
It contains images with titles.
I (german OOo) want to modify this document and need to add images. Document
language and local settings are set to english. Adding a title (german
'Beschriftung') to the image creates the title 'Abbildung', numbering is correct
with all the existing 'Image' titles . Example: 'Image 1: afdsfasdf', 'Abbildung
2: dsafdsf' (that's the one I inserted), 'Image 3: fdsafdsf'. 
If I force the insertion of the title 'Image', numbering is wrong. Example:
'Image 1: afdsfasdf', 'Image 1: dsafdsf' (that's the one I inserted), 'Image 2:
fdsafdsf'. 
Possible cause: translating the document to a german OOo platform, the title
'Image' is translated to 'Abbildung'.
Work around: Insertion of title 'Abbildung' then change this title to 'Image'.
Proposed behaviour: no translation of titles ('Beschriftungen'). So if a
numbered title was called 'Image' it shall keept that name and not be
translated. But I wonder, there must have been a reason why this has been inserted.

http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=5502
http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4834
and so on,

HOWEVER, they miss the point (and were closed nevertheless). I will propose a
more comprehensive approach to this issue, allowing a very flexible casing
(because of this, I started a new request).

I will shortly desribe this algorithm/feature:
In a text we may have:
 - characters starting a sentence (_Sentence)
 - characters starting a word, but not a sentence (_Word_Begin)
 - and chars inside a word (_Word_Inside)

We may have the following casing options:
 - Case_NOP (NO Operation): leave case as is
 - Case_Upper: make uppercase
 - Case_Lower: make lowercase
 - Case_Custom: some custom casing function (like reverse, weird,...)

The casing applied by OO.o would be:
 - _Sentence = Case_Upper
 - _Word_Begin = Case_Upper
 - _Word_Inside = Case_NOP

But I would prefer, e.g.:
 - _Sentence = Case_Upper
 - _Word_Begin = Case_Upper
 - _Word_Inside = Case_Lower,

while others may want:
 - _Sentence = Case_Upper
 - _Word_Begin = Case_NOP
 - _Word_Inside = Case_Lower.

Having the possibility to apply such diverse (custom) casing would be a great
feature. I will append a C++ program I wrote, that implements this, however that
started as my 'Hello World' program, and, although it ended with template
classes, you should strongly consider rewriting it. (I used it to format
filenames.) If anyone wishes to enhance that program or to port it to other
systems/ programming languages (like java), feel free to do so.

Right now, the Wizard generates a 'preview' of all merged documents before the

"The proposal is to to add a new object that is similar to bookmarks

This enhancement is required to support the Bibliographic enhancements. The 
data fields in the bibliography need to support complex formatted text and 
objects and this is not possible with the current text field. For example some 
scientific document titles need to be able to display words in Italics. 
Mathematical titles need to represent equations. I am sure that that this 
feature would also be of benefit in other areas.

In discussing how to achieve this, Oliver Specht, has advised that the best 
approach was to enhance the bookmark object. 

A possible solution is 'to add a new object that is similar to bookmarks 
(com.sun.star.text.Bookmark). This extended bookmark would also carry a DOM 
tree property. This 'bookmark' can span over formatted text longer than a 
paragraph. The user can modify the text inside of this bookmark easily. 
An interface to access the new elements needs to be implemented (sorted by 
document position). 
The DOM interfaces are in com.sun.star.xml.dom. (e.g. XDocument.idl, 
XNode.idl, XElement.idl) 
There's also a service com.sun.star.xml.dom.DocumentBuilder available that 
supports the creation of DOM trees. 
The bibliography component works on the DOM tree and can manipulate it 
independently. In case of using a field the component has to set the resulting

"Dear All,

<summary> 
I already reported #59688 that in a writer document on opening for *all* linked
images inside memory is allocated. In case you use writer for e.g. provide some
nice text around your (linked) digikam jpegs, it can result in a hog of a huge
amount of memory (up to 800 MB for me).
  
Including OOo 2.0.2 you could work around and set free most memory if you go
through all pages in file -> page preview. Page by page you see reduction in
e.g. a task monitor.

In the current Linux rpm-release of 2.0.3 I noticed a regression: page preview
workaround does not anymore set free memory, nor it is freed by closing the
document itself. Of course closing OOo frees as last resort.

The windows version of 2.0.3 does not suffer this new issue, so I suspect the
Linux rpm's to be in some way defect. 

<own test environments and results>
Verified under Suse 9.3 and 10.1 using OOo rpm's, english and german version -->
showed above behaviour
Tested W2K SP4, german version --> worked as in 2.0.2
Tested Novell's 2.0.3 rpm's for 10.1
(ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/OpenOffice.org/10.1-i386/*) --> worked too, but may
be of older RC-basis, as Novell does often 'patch' it's own sources

<Test case / description of reproduction>
- use example file from enhancement req. #59688 or generate a new writer file
and add ~30 different high resoltion (e.g. digikam) jpegs (1600x1200 or more)
and save it.
- open a task monitor to follow memory usage
- restart OOo 2.0.3 and open above sample file
- notice increasing amount of memory on opening as all images are loaded (all
OOo versions 2.x.x)
- Try to set free memory by file -> page preview and browsing through all pages.
2.0.3 will only decrease minimaly ~10%, <=2.0.2 decrease up to 95%
- Try to close document, but not OOo itself. 2.0.3 -> keeps used memory; <=
2.0.2 sets free all remaining used memory by document

<own evaluation on effect>
For my case ('Photoalbum' using ~800 MB on 1 GB main mem) using OOo 2.0.3 Linux
version slows noticably down my machine because of swapping. Maybe this new
'behaviour' has any more side effects.

"Wildcards in Replacement List

One of the most useful features in OOo Writer is the replacement list. I rely
heavily on it and it greatly simplifies the writing of many documents.

However, there are some situations, where I need something more advanced.

To better understand my request, I will start with a common word in my
replacement list:
sx => susceptibil (English susceptible, I use it often when describing bacterial
susceptibilities to antibiotics)

While in English there is only one form, in many Latin languages (like Romanian,
but also Italian, French and many more), adjectives and nouns unfortunately must
conjugate depending on gender and number. Therefore at least 4 (2x2) forms exist
for any adjective (actually even more forms do exist and even nouns will be
conjugated in a complex fashion).

Lets look at the previous example:
m, singular: susceptibil
f, singular: susceptibila
m, plural: susceptibili
f, plural: susceptibile
(other forms are: susceptibilul, susceptibilii, susceptibilele)

It would be completely irrational to have (at least) 4 entries in the
replacement list for the same word. And it becomes even more impractical to
remember the shortcuts for all those entries.

My first impression was, why shouldn't I simply write 'sx' followed by all those
different endings and have the 'sx' inside e.g. 'sxa' or 'sxi' be automatically
expanded to 'susceptibil'. The problem is that only a word-delimited 'sx' will
be expanded.

Here is a wise solution to this problem: use wildcards!

In the foregoing example this would have looked like:
sx[aeilu]* => 'susceptibil\1' (where '\1' means to automatically append any
characters written after 'sx', but this could be implicit, without explicitly
writing the '\1' identifier);

The advantages are obvious, only one item is in the replacement list (list is
much shorter now) and there is only one shortcut to remember.

Why use wildcards and do not replace any occurrence of 'sx'?
Well, some words may contain the shortcut and we wouldn't like to expand that,
too. To illustrate this for 'sx': I also use 'sxt' as a shortcut for one
antibiotic (Cotrimoxazole = Trimethoprime + Sulfamethoxazole, classically
written as SXT). Another example would be:
rz => rezistent (English resistant)
rz[aei]* =>  'rezistent\1' , however Tarzan does contain an 'rz', too. (Well, I
do not often write the word Tarzan, but for the sake of perfection, I do prefer
the wildcards method.)

IF it takes more time to implement this feature, I would agree also with the
non-wildcard method to replace any occurrence of the shortcut. Alternatively,
define 2 types of replacement lists: one for replacements of every occurrence,
and one for replacements of only word-delimited shortcuts.

An added benefit of this feature is an elegant workaround for bug
http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4579 : instead of defining
keyboard shortcuts for special characters, we define shortcuts in the
replacement list.
.*tz.* => '\1Å£\2'
.*a>.* => '\1Äƒ\2'
and so on. (.* means any character) This would be equally effective to any
method based on keyboard shortcuts.

To further illustrate the usefulness of wildcards, I end with another example,
this time with a noun:
(English: diagnosis)
singular: diagnostic, diagnosticul
plural: diagnostice,  diagnosticele
replacement list: dx[elu]* => diagnostic\1
(the first form of the noun is as for 'the'+'noun', and the second form is a
special form in Romanian, something like when 'the' has been removed from the
beginning and appended to the noun itself)","ENHANCEMENT"

Accept any of

 * Unicode minus (U+2212) or
 * Unicode en-dash (U+2013),
as a numeric negative sign, for purposes of number recognition and formula
calculation in Writer tables.

Rationale:

Writer tables may contain numbers and formulas that are automatically recognized
(at least by default) and treated specially. In programming languages it is
acceptable to require the use of ASCII hyphen-minus (U+002D) to indicate a
negative number. In Writer tables however, using typical typesetting fonts, the
ASCII minus looks awkward, since it is typically much narrower than either a
numeric digit or the plus sign. For typeset documents, it is preferable to use
either Unicode minus (U+2212), or possibly a en-dash (U+2013; for fonts that do
not have the Unicode minus) to write a negative number.
Unfortunately, no character other than ASCII hyphen-minus is recognized as
'numeric'. A negative number written with either of these preferable alternates
is not recognized as a number at all, and is ignored for calculations.","DEFECT"

"Hello,

I'd like to report this bug that shows up when using User Fields, with Formulaes
and Variables.

It's a bit difficult to explain. Basically, when modifying a numeric User Field
variable in a formula, it seems to set to zero the other operands.
Let's say you have 'var=2 and var*2=4'. The first '2' is the value of the
variable 'var', '4' is the (right) result of the formula 'var*2'. Now,
modifying 'var' by clicking on '2' and entering a new value simply sets the
result of the formula to... 0.

Still a bit unclear ? Let me provide a step by step description.
- Open a new Text document.
- Go to Insert->Field...->Other...
- Go to Variables
- Select 'User Field' in the 'Type' column (the leftmost one), type a name
(we'll call it 'var') and create the User Field (using the 'V' button).
- Now select 'Input field' in the 'Type' column, 'var' should be highlighted in
'Selection'.
- Click on 'Insert' : a dialog box appears. Type a numeric value, let's say 1,
in the bottom text area. Click OK.
- Type in a few spaces, and go to Insert->Field...->Other...->Variables again.
- This time select 'Insert Formula'.
- In the 'Formula' text area, type for example 'var * 10' (without quotes).
Insert the formula, the result is properly calculated.
- For the sake of the example, let's create an other field with the exact same
formula a bit further in the text.
- Modify 'var' by clicking on its field, type in 2 for example.
-> The first formula is set to 0, the second is properly calculated.

Changing the formula a bit (using var + 10 instead for example), it would seem
the operands after var are set to 0.

Two workarounds for this:
- In simple formulaes like this, putting var last seems to get the formula to be
calculated properly.
- Modifying in any way the document (except modifying the buggy formula itself).
Typing anything seems to get the formula to be calculated properly.","DEFECT"

"I saw someone struggle with this issue for a good 30 minutes until I showed her
how to format the list to look the way she wanted. Yes, formatting the list is
probably the more correct way to fix this within OO.o, but the fact that she
struggled with this for so long shows that it wasn't intuitive to her.

Here is the issue from the user's point of view.

1) Open OO.o word processor.
2) Type '1. <something>' where <something> is some text.
3) Hit enter.
4) As the user expects OO.o auto-formats the text for a numbered list. What the
user also expects is that she can easily remove that auto-formatting. She does
not like the auto-indenting OO.o does.
5) She selects all the text in the numbering area and toggles the numbering
button on the toolbar. This removes the indentation, but also the numbering.
6) She goes to reinsert the numbering hoping OO.o is smart enough to realize she
doesn't want the auto-formatting this time.
7) When she hits enter at the end of the line, OO.o auto-formats again. By
repeating 5 & 6 she is stuck in an infinite loop trying to get the document the
way she wants.

In this example the auto-formatting features of OO.o hindered productivity.

Now there exists an easy way for the user to fix this. Highlight the numbering
and then Format->Bullets and Numbering...

The user didn't know how to use this until I showed her, but she also figured
the program would be smart enough that if it could figure out she might want
auto-formatting that it should be smart enough to realize when she doesn't want it.

She would have gotten what she wanted much quicker if OO.o worked this way:

1) Open OO.o word processor.
2) Type '1. <something>' where <something> is some text.
3) hit enter.
4) As the user expects OO.o auto-formats the text for a numbered list.
5) The user selects the numbering area and toggles the numbering button.
6) The indenting disappears but the number, as the user originally placed it,
remains.
7) As the user continues with her list it doesn't auto-format at EACH number.

is happy with her document and she created it quickly without frustration.","DEFECT"

"One problem with indexing in OOo (and in Word) is that the user never knows in
advance whether an entry will have children.

If the user assumes that there will be no children, then they enter (for example):
     file, archiving

Later on, the user wants to enter:
     file, restoring

So the user must delete the entry:
     file, archiving

and change to:
     file
        archiving
        restoring

The reverse can also happen. In other words, the user may assume that there
would be more children, so they enter:
     file
        archiving

Later on, they find that in fact there were no more children, so the entry must
be changed to:
     file, archiving

I suggest that the user should be able to enter in the 'Insert Index Entry' dialog:
     Entry:     archiving
     1st key:   file

Then OOo can make the decision. If there is only one child, the printed entry in
the index becomes:
     file, archiving

If there is more than one child, the entry becomes:
     file
        archiving
        restoring

Of course, if 'restoring' were later deleted, the entry would revert to:
     file, archiving

"Each of the toolbar items 'Font Color', 'Highlighting' and 'Background Color'
employ a pop-up color picker. While the toolbar items show the current status
(either the last-used color or the color at the cursor), the pop-up color picker
does not. It would be helpful if the picker would also indicate which color was
active, the same as shown in the toolbar item.

Rationale:
Let's say I have set the background color of a paragraph to a light gray, but on
further reflection, the color is a little too dark; I want to set it to the next
lighter shade. I click on the 'Background Color' item in the toolbar and the
color picker pops up. Which swatch is the right one? I have to remember the
color name I last picked, or I have to guess based on comparing the display of
the current paragraph to the small swatch in the picker--a difficult task for
similar colors. If the picker indicated the current color, as the full Format >
Paragraph > Background dialog does, it would be trivially easy to pick the next
lighter shade.

Supporting enhancement:
Add the current color name to the tooltips for these items. Instead of
'Background Color', the tooltip would read 'Background Color: Gray 20%'. This
would make it easy to accurately determine the current setting.","ENHANCEMENT"

"Hi!

I am currently editing a document which uses fields. It was a long document, but
I reduced it to two text lines, one which defines a field, the second one using
the field (I'm going to attach it...)

Now to the problem:
I can't enable 'field shading'. I tried it from the menu, I found the color
configuration dialog and tried giving it a different color and enabling it from
there, and I enabled/disabled use of OpenGL, but fields can't be enabled in this
document. Even when the cursor is left to the field, I see no shading at all.
The reference itself works perfect: if I change text and press F9 the change is
reflected immediately.

An update to OpenOffice 2.0.3 (SuSE Linux 10.1) didn't change the situation, so
it seems I have a document which is broken in some way.

If I create a new OO Writer document, all fields I insert are colored in the
color I configured for shaded fields earlier, and I can enable/disable field
shading as desired, so it really is my other document which must be broken.

BTW the document is originally converted from PDF by KWord and then edited in
OpenOffice.

"OK, I think that this date and time in a macro thing is a bug. Here is what I do

I click on insert > fields > other, and then I select the type of time that I

I close the fields box
I hit enter twice to give me a blank line and put the cursor on a second line
I click on the left justify button on the toolbar, to left justify my text
I click on stop recording macro and name my macro

OK. In past versions of Open Office, this worked great when done exactly as I
described above. (The following examples just aren't formatting the way I use
them). Any time I opened up a new document, I could run this macro and get the
date and time in the format I wanted, for example:
Fri, October 06, 2006 6:55 PM

When I first record the macro in ver. 2.0.3, it works great in the document I
recorded it in. Can use it repeatedly and it works. Can save the document and
open it later, and it works fine. But in a new document it puts in the raw data
like:

38995.79 38995.79

It also does this in a document that I create the macro in and use the macro in
(and it works great in the document as long as it is in Open Office Writer
format) but if I use 'save as' and save the document in another format such as
.rtf then it doesn't work - again it puts the data in raw format.

Now I HAVE found a workaround:

You use the macro in a new document. It puts the data in as raw data, but spaced
and everything the way you wanted it. You select one of the fields and right
click, and on the pop-up menu that comes up you select fields, and go back and
reselect the date in the format you want and click on OK. At this point, it
doesn't change it back, it stays as the raw data format. Then, you click on view
> field names. Now, the fields go to this format :

Date (fixed) Time (fixed)

OK. Now, you go back and click on view > field names (which deselects viewing as
field names) again, and after you do this it changes back, but instead of the
raw data format you get the date in the format you want and the time in the
format you want, spaced and laid out the way you wanted it to.

Of course this is a lot of steps to go through in a document where you might
only want to use the date and time once. Better to just Insert the data and
insert the time, laying it out in whatever arrangement you want to have it in
manually. Lot less work and a lot less steps. I tried doing the macro in a blank
new document, erase everything and then save that document as the default
document. But this doesn't work as a work-around, you get the raw data and have
to go through the work-around I described above. The following is the macro text

mouse, the pointer moves, but it remains hourglass shape until you take it to
the red X ('close this window') button in the window's bar. The only function it
allows is to click on this 'close window' button. But if I close the window,
Window pops up its 'this application does not respond' dialog.

"This is a strange one...

The issue is, once the bug is triggered, whenever you initiate the prompt for
Input Fields (either using 'ctrl-shift-F9' or when dbl-clicking on a template),
it prompts for all of the fields, then does it AGAIN - so, prompts for all of
the fields TWICE. Interestingly, deleting ALL of the Input Fields from both the
Header and Footer results in all of the Fields still being prompted for (even
though there are none there), but this time only once.

What I did to reproduce it was:

1. Modify the 'Default' Page Style of the newly created document to contain
Headers and Footers, then place Input Fields into them. Save it.

2. Create a new Page Style based on the 'Default' (which should be the current
selection) by using the 'New Style from Selection' option in 'Styles and
Formatting' > 'Page Styles'.

3. Apply the newly created Style by dbl-clicking it.

4. Initiate the prompt for Input Fields ('ctrl-shift-F9').

5. You should be dbl-prompted for the fields.

NOTE: this bug does NOT trigger (at least it didn't for me) if you create the
Page Styles you want to use and apply them BEFORE you add the Input Fields to
the Header/Footer.

In other words, it should be reproducible by simply copying the 'Default' page
style to a custom one, then changing the current Page Style to the newly created
custom one.

I will attach three sample documents (templates are affected the same way), one
that doesn't exhibit the bug (before I changed the Page Styles), one that DOES
exhibit the bug (AFTER I changed the Page Styles), and one that I deleted ALL of
the Input Fields from AFTER the bug was triggered, which still prompts for all
of the Input Fields, but this time only once.

I have not been able to 'fix' a document once the bug is triggered. In fact,
deleting EVERYTHING in a broken document results in ALL of the Input Fields that

"Open a large document several times and wait. Observe the total page count at
the status line. The writer keeps changing the total page counrt for a long
time. Finally, when the number SEEMS stabilized, you will see that the page
count is different each time, although the document is never modified!

This creates huge problems in shared documents: You cannot talk about page
numbers, as the page numbers can change by up to 6!

The problem is also there when a pdf file is created out of the odt file: If a
feedback comes based on the pdf file, when you open the original odt file, you
will not understand what's the discussion about: The text would have jumped to
another page.

Quite a frustrating experience.

Desired:
1. Temporal consistency: The algorithm must produce identical formatting even if
the document is opened several times and closed without editing anything. 

2. User/PC-level consistency: If the same shared document is opened by several
users in different machines, its layout on EACH page must be EXACTLY identical,
as if they are looking at the same document.

Seems to be consistent from at least OOo1.1.5 (don't have an older version) to

How to reproduce: 
1. Open a new Writer document
2. Activate View - Field Names (must be marked)
3. Hit <ENTER> two or three times (not necessary but easier to describe)
4. Enter Date from Insert - Field - Date

Document will show 'date (fixed)'

5. Postion cursor before the field
6. Right click on field to open context menu
7. Choose Field
8. Modify 'date (fixed)' to 'date' in second column.
9. Hit 'OK'

Expected result: Document shows 'Date' as field name

Actual result: Document shows 'Date (fixed)'

Right description is shown immediately if you:
- remove or add any character in the document (just hit <BACKSPACE> to remove
the paragraph before)
- toggle Field Names (in View menu) off and on again
- add step 8b after 8: choose another date format in the third column of the dialog.

So I assume that toggling between 'date' and 'date 'fixed' is assumed not to
change the view of the document and therefore it is not refreshed. If field
names are invisible, this is true: the date itself is not changed. But with
visible field names the change is not shown either.

This bug might be a P5 either, as it occurs rarely and doesn't have any impact
on functionality. But for people working with visible field names this scenario
could lead to some irritations.

"Chapter 7 of the developers guide discusses iterating over text in a Writer
document. In particular:

'Paragraphs also have an com.sun.star.container.XEnumerationAccess of their own.
 They can enumerate every single text portion that they contain. A text portion
is a text range containing a uniform piece of information that appears within
the text flow. An ordinary paragraph, formatted in a uniform manner and
containing nothing but a string, enumerates just a single text portion. In a
paragraph that has specially formatted words or other contents, the text portion
enumeration  returns one com.sun.star.text.TextPortion service for each
differently formatted string, and for every other text content. Text portions
include the service com.sun.star.text.TextRange and have the properties listed
below:'

Thus objects anchored at a character, such as graphic objects, can be found in
their logical order by iterating over the containing paragraph, but objects such
as graphic objects, that are anchored at a paragraph are not returned when
iterating over the paragraphs of the document using the code illustration:
       // Here, we access this interface
        XEnumerationAccess xParaAccess = (XEnumerationAccess)
UnoRuntime.queryInterface(
            XEnumerationAccess.class, mxDocText);
        // Call the XEnumerationAccess's only method to access the actual
Enumeration
        XEnumeration xParaEnum = xParaAccess.createEnumeration();
        // While there are paragraphs, do things to them
        while (xParaEnum.hasMoreElements()) {
}

There appears to be no documented method to iterate over all objects in a Writer
document in order as is required for a filter.

1)  have a box to manually enter a word (called 'Replace With' in the Thunderbird)

2)  have a button to check the word you just typed in (called 'Check Word' in

A)  sometimes the incorrect spelling to so wildly misspelled that OO does not
even come close to what you want and you need to try a second again.  Adding the

B)  the Thunderbird method has really helped my spelling, as I can rapidly take

Put the anchor of the frame in a section and protect the section. Now the frame

"Words with hyphens are hyphenated with double hyphens in Polish, according to
the Polish orthography (for instance, hyphenation of 'kong-fu' -> kong- -fu).

When I tried to set this hyphenation, there was a competition between the base
hyphenation of hyphens (it's independent from the hyphenation settings and the
hyphenator!) and the non-standard hyphenation by OOo's hyphenator. The result
was an occasional non-standard hyphenation (sometimes kong- fu, sometimes kong-

optionally, and to use only hyphenation patterns.","ENHANCEMENT"

This is not entirely obvious !

1) Although the misspelling is in red in the 'Not in Dictionary' window it can 
take some finding in the main text as the word does not appear highlighted. 
Maybe that's a bug and I should put in a separate report in for it.

2) I automatically look for a 'Replace With' entry field, along with the

component precedes the Text component. Similarly, file2.odt is inserted before
Text or file1.odt, depending upon which is selected before the insertion. Then,
the user must manually drag the components into the desired first-to-last order.

"Select a paragraph beginning with an accented vowel:
Format > Paragraph > DropCaps > Show DropCap

The space allowed for the single drop capital does not necessarily display the accent when italic/
decorative fonts are used. In some cases, it cuts most of it off.

Since this is a decorative feature, its performance with decorative fonts is even more important than it 
normally would be.

See the attached file for screenshots of a successful single drop cap (standard font), a very unsuccessful 
single drop cap (italic/decorative font) and a moderately successful (see issue 39994) whole-word drop 
cap (italic/decorative font).

Since our language (Vietnamese) is almost completely composed of characters with combined diacritics, 
this bug really prevents us making any effective use of the drop caps feature.

Note also the extraneous marks above the drop cap area: these are parts of accents cut off (not covered 
by the area created) by previous attempts to create drop caps. For some reason, these disconnected 
marks remain displayed after the drop cap has been undone or replaced! Changing the view (zoom etc.) 
removes them, but they shouldn't be there in the first place.

"When establishing OpenOffice.org for business use, the direct PDF export is one
of the primary advantages. 
But in practical use one feature is missing: different properties for (special

include Logos and sender-address, typical placed in a seperat Textbox (frame).
If you want to print the same letter using your PC-printer, then normaly
preprinted paper is used, so logos and/or sender-address (this spezial frame)
should not be printed. 
OK, actuell you can change the printing-property of each element, but this ist -
when using different objects - not a real choise.
A real advantage here should be a second property-value for objects (grafics,
frames,...), which spezifies printing on a printer (as it is now) and visible

they are inserted into an empty document via 'Insert->File...'. Here is how to
reproduce:

1) create a new empty writer document
2) Insert->File... and select the attached file pagebreak_noSection.odt

The content of pagebreak_noSection.odt is shown at the FIRST page of the result

The file pagebreak_noSection is very simple: there are only two paragraphs with
the content 'a' and 'b'. The first paragraph is formatted with the set
formatting option Format->Paragraph/TextFlow/Breaks/Insert (Type Page).

When inserting that document into the new empty document, the insert method
correctly recognizes that there is no content at the first page of the empty
document (so the document already starts with a new page) and DOES NOT produce a
pagebreak.

NOW:

1) create a new empty writer document
2) Insert->File... and select the attached file pagebreak_WITHSection.odt

The content of pagebreak_WITHSection.odt is shown at the SECOND page of the

content at the first page.

The file pagebreak_WITHSection differs from the first document only in one small
point: there is a section around the first paragraph 'a'.

When inserting that document into the new empty document, the insert method
wrongly creates a new paragraph before the section. Hence the document is no
longer empty and an unwanted pagebreak is produced. I think everything would be
OK, if the empty paragraph before the inserted section would not be produced in

"Hello, 
querying the bugs database i found some bugs regarding the problem, that using
the 'NextRecord' field command (Feldbefehl in german) breaks the evaluation of
conditional formating. As i found, all issues are marked as 'fixed', but in my
constellation, the problem still exists. 

I have a database (tried ODBC, csv, Calc-table; no difference) with some records
containing accounting info. I created a writer document with a table with enough
rows to hold the maximum possible records for one bill. Each table row
(=database record) should be preceded by a little text. When the records are
less than the number of rows, the row of course shouldn't contain this text. So
i defined a conditional text like database.table.field NEQ '' 'Preceding Text '
ELSE ''. This is ok until the _last_ record is retrieved. In all subsequent rows
following the _last retrieved_ record, they evaluate like the last one did. IMO,
when the 'end-of-file' is reached, evaluating the conditionals are stopped.
Reproducing this issue is very simple and works for all versions of OOo:

1) Create a CSV file containing some fields (lets assume 'Name' and 'Street')
and enter two (2) records:

'Bugsbunny';'Top of the hill'
'Donald Duck';'Somewhere'

2) Make a data connection to access the csv file in Writer
3) Create an empty Writer document, insert a table with five(!!) rows and three
columns. 
4) Drag'n'drop 'Name' to the first col on each row, 'Street' to the third. 
5) In column two insert a conditional text like db.table.Street EQ 'Somewhere'
'this shouldn't happen' ELSE ''.
6) After the database field 'Street' in each of the five rows insert the
'NextRecord' field (not in the last row, but that doesn't matter).
7) Print and you will see. Row three to five have 'this shouldn't happen' in
column two as the last printed record evaluated to this.","DEFECT"

with the text.  The larger issue is when inserting a full page frame for a large
graphic.  The desire is to have the placement of the frame be on the page after
the related text.  Using the â€œanchor to characterâ€? does not work well in this
case, often inserting numerous extra blank pages.  The current â€œanchor to pageâ€?
does not meet my needs because it does not keep the frame relative to related
text, so if pages are inserted earlier in the document the related text ends up
on a page later than the frame.

I understand that currently â€œanchor to pageâ€? is an absolute anchor to a specific
page number, and agree with that functionality.

My suggestion is for a new anchor type: â€œanchor to a page relative to a
characterâ€?.  With this anchor type you could insert the object next to the
character you wanted it related to, select this new anchor type, and then set
its page relativity to that character.  You would be able to specify if it
should be anchored to same page as character, a page before, or a page after.  I
envision an integer entry box with increment and decrement buttons, with 0 for
the same page, negative for before, and positive for following.  This way a
frame set to â€œanchor to page relative to characterâ€? and 1 would always show up
on the page after the anchor point.

"A formula in a table cell can refer to another cell. Such a reference is, in
effect, replaced by the value of the other cell. If the formula in a cell
consists of nothing but a reference to another cell, the formula produces a copy
of the other cell.

So, if in cell A1 we have '123' and cell A2 we have the formula '=<A1>', cell A2
will be a copy of cell A1.

In Calc, this replacement works transparently for any value a cell can hold. In
Writer, this behavior only holds for numeric values.

Steps to reproduce:

1. File > New > Text Document
2. Insert > Table... OK (Accept default 2x2)
3. Select table; Number format = Text
4. In cell A1:
   Enter: '01080'
5. In cell A2:
   Enter: = (Formula bar grabs focus) Click on cell A1;
   formula bar shows '=<A1>' Enter.

Cell A2 now shows '1080' instead of '01080'

6. In cell A1:
   Clear contents (Ctrl+A;Delete)
   Enter: 'Abc' 
   Note: formula in A2 does not update.
   Tools > Update > Update all

Cell A2 now shows '0' instead of 'Abc'

I encountered this when I needed a table to show the same data in two different
fonts: human-readable in one column, as bar codes in the other column. The data
are mostly numeric but may have leading zeros (which are significant), or
punctuation.

Unfortunately, this problem makes Writer unsuitable for this task, as it is very
difficult to visually check for missing zeros or non-updated fields when the
data appear as bar codes. The two columns need to match perfectly and reliably.

Using Calc might be one workaround, but I need to make labels, for which Writer
is far better suited.

Using fields is another possible workaround. Fields can accurately copy the
data, but cannot be used for a whole table full of such data.","ENHANCEMENT"
"The envelope printing feature accessible via Insert --> Envelopeâ€¦ needs an
option to specify that the envelope loading orientation is horizontally flipped
with respect to the default one.
Ideally, a new checkbox called 'Flip horizontal' should be placed in the Printer
tab of the Envelope dialog. Its activation should horizontally flip all the
envelope incons in the six available feeding position representation (and
obviously the final print should reflect this change).
This is absolutely needed if the printer cannot succesfully load envelopes with
the default orientation. This is the case, for example, of my Epson Stylus C86

"When closing an unsaved document, the user is presented with a familiar dialog:
'The document %s has been modified.  Do you want to save your changes?'  This
dialog should include either a 'View Changes' option, or less modally, simply
include a preview pane.

Rationale:

Everyone has at some point viewed this dialog and asked, 'What changes?'

OO.o is somewhat egregious in this regard because invisible metadata changes
(possibly including the time of last printing?) can flag the in-memory copy of a
document as 'changed.'

The undo feature already preserves most of the information required to provide
this feature in a meaningful manner. ['Did I make some major change, or did I
typo one garbage character before I paged down?']

The confirmation dialog blocks use or review of the window in question anyway,
so there is no reason not to devote as much screen real-estate as necessary to
the task.  

[Motivation to keep the warning dialog compact stems from the assumption that
context for the most recent change will be visible behind it.  This assumption
fails when the change has been to metadata or navigation has occurred, as when
reviewing a long document or, in today's more stable environments, returning to
a forgotten window after hours or days.]

Privacy is not impacted ['The boss is a jerk^H^H^H^Hreally nice guy.'] if the
diff is only exposed by intentional action, such as selecting a button or
'expanding' a preview pane.

Security is not impacted to the extent that any mechanism which relies on user
error or confusion to preserve an audit log (last-printing metadata) should
never have been expected to be reliable anyway.

Making metadata changes visible improves its utility by informing the user of
its existence.

---

This idea has bounced around in interaction-design circles for so long that I'm
not sure who to credit it to; it certainly isn't my own invention.  However, it
did bite me again tonight and I'm surprised that I haven't been able to find an
existing request in OO.o's bugtracker.

Of course, if expanding the dialog to fit a proper diff, it might be worth
exposing a 'Save as a new document' option (when the diff is visible) for the
common case of a user discovering they've been using an old document as a template.","ENHANCEMENT"
"Users often desire both preservation (logging, archival) of important data and
privacy (protection from unintended archival) of ephemeral data.  Inferring
intent from performance of actions which create trails elsewhere -- printing,
e-mail -- strikes an appropriate balance and increases opportunity to
appropriately use the versioning feature.

A simple implementation would add a 'Print and Save a Version' and 'E-Mail and
Save a Version' option to dialogs for the respective actions; in this way the
user can preserve a snapshot of what they're already expressing intent to
produce irrevocable copies of.  (Printed copies might be binned or shredded, but
at least a bare majority of them are produced for exchange.)

Privacy doesn't take a hit because these actions are already creating a real or
digital 'paper trail' the user probably wants a personal record of; making the
action an explicit new option also preserves a sense of control, though it could
be made a preference that would present the inverse when made default.  

(Control+P, Enter to print and Control+P, V to 'Print and Version' -- or N to
'Print and Not Version' if the preference to default to versioning is set?)","ENHANCEMENT"

We use spaces in inputfields as default content to get better clickable(see

"contextually invoke formula editor in appropriate mode.

Software intelligence can be built into open office writer 
creating a formula object in the right 'mode' depending on the 
invocation 'context'. It is very distracting and disconcerting to 
repeatedly set right modes on formula objects when creating documents
with lots of formula objects.

Formula editor has two modes. 
1) 'text mode' in which the formula editor squishes the object 
to display within line height.
This mode is used when the author wishes to type equations directly 
in a paragraph, as part of some explanation, without making
the paragraph look bad due to varying line spacing.
2) 'normal mode' in which the formula editor displays the object 
with as much space as needed to present the formula.
This mode is used when the author wishes to have the equations stand
out clearly with 

Usually when typing formula in a paragraph there could be many 
'inline equations' referred to as 'text mode' formula by 
'formula editor'. 

Currently the Writer always invokes the formula editor to make 
a 'normal mode' formula. This requires the user to repeatedly  
set the right mode often multiple times for every formula object 
within a paragraph.

Suggesting
1) Formula Object be invoked in text mode if within an ordinary
   paragraph style.
2) Formula Object be invoked in normal mode, if in a style 
   (say named equation style) which has been created with an 
   option not to squish objects to line height. 
3) Formula Object be invoked in normal mode, when the 'fn'

"Automatic word completion is noted by many journalists as a key benefit and 
difference of OO Writer from MS Word. I particularly use it to reduce strain 
on my hands.

Currently it only supports single words, I believe. However, individuals often 
use specific phrases that they like or that are needed by a client i.e. to 
remain integrated with other documents. So a number of multi-word phrases are 
likely to appear many times in a large document (especially technical docs).

I would like to propose that this function be extended to include phrases as 
well. For example if it remembered 'from client to server' then when I 
type 'client t' it will see a potential multiword phrase, and suggest 'client 
to server' as a completion.

To keep things sane I believe this would require the document to be indexed in 
real time and a running count of frequency of phrase usage for the current 
session be maintained. A simple heuristic would note phrases that appear often 
and add them to the word completion file (perhaps this is autocorr).

The suggestions would become even more useful if for example there are two 
commonly used long phrases that are similar up to a certain point, and the wor 
d completion function could suggest a choice between them in a way similar to 
Visual Studio style function suggestions, but this is really icing on the cake.

Since the autocomplete function is so evidently useful, and is I think a major 
point for it over competitors, I believe it should be improved.

Therefore I have submitted this recommendation, and also have at the same time 
submitted a recommendation for the ability to save the autocor file on a

"I've always grappled with this problem... hope someone can help.... 

Many of my tables in Writer have a background colour set, sometimes for the 
whole table, and sometimes just for the header. This is just for aesthetics, to 
highlight the table information. I print to a black-and-white laser printer. So 
far, I've set very light colours for the background, so the table background 
shows up nicely... as light grey, while the texts are standard black. 

The problem occurs when I have to fax the document out, either directly from my 
PC, or manually through a fax machine. The standard fax resolution is lower, 
and everything is converted to black and white.... for fax transmission. The 
table background shows up as black dots... and obscures the table text content.

There's a setting to not print the document's _overall_ page background.... but 
is there something similar just for the _table_ background. 

It seems like a useful feature to incorporate.... Pls. improve the future OO

"Hi.

Often we are too focused on technical merits of document import from foreign
formats. However, often the technical merits are not as relevant as the very
shape of document, that is often very poor itself, despite of technically
perfect import results.

OOo lacks useful features for correcting the badly written documents. And You
probably know that situations, when You get such a document and MUST cope with
it, edit it and/or forward. Without heavy manual reparing, it is often
impossible to do any further editing on such a document.

I suggest something, maybe inside Tools menu, that would provide users a tool to
comfortably correct the badly written document.

Users would love it! I think this could become a huge marketing tool when
implemented.

I'll provide more detailed sub-tasks as separate issues. For the first
approach,as an interface, I'd assume a window similar to deletion window in
Calc, where You can choose, which data You wish to delete.
The 'Bad Document Correction Tool' would allow a window, where user could select
one or more 'Correction functions'. More powerful if there was also some kinda
preview window such as in graphical programs, where the user could see the
results immediately.","ENHANCEMENT"
"This is related to Issue 75524.

One option of 'Bad Document Correcting Tool' could offer the intelligent removal
of unnecessarry line breaks, being the sub-option of general BDC Tool.

Purpose:
Some users type the text on PC the same way they did on mechanical typewriters
-they give a line break at the end of every line. Such document is impossible to
format, one must manually delete the line breaks. Moreover, if the document
suffered some printer-aided reformatting, the situation is even worse -You have
for example single line of text continuing on the next line (single word or a
few) and THEN suddenly the line break. Next line performs similary and so on.

I'm talking about the same effect as in the mail clients that put line breaks
automatically. Then You open the mail in other mail client, forward it etc. At
the end, You have the mentioned ugly corrupted formatting of text.

So, the option should offer a convenient way of automatical removal of such
mis-breaked lines. An algorithm is to be made to do the proper mis-breaked line
detection, for the start some simple set of rules could do:


1, The text section should be considered as 'intended consistent', if there is
no empty line. Other words, even if the text contains line breaks, it is
considered as 'should be consistent' if it dosen't contain ENTIRELY EMPTY line.
Other words, the text between two empty lines is considered as single consistent
block.
The 'line mis-breaks' should be removed on this general basis, with more fine
tuned heuristics rules as follows:

2, The line is considered 'intentionally ended (with line break that should
remain untouched)' if it's length is less than, say, 3/4 of the full line length.

3, If in the defined 'intended consistent' block there are lines, that are just
a few (up to, say, 20) letters longer than full line length (so that just few
characters are in the next line and then ended with line break), it is
considered as probably line mis-break.

4, The lines, that contain bullets or numbering at the beginning, are considered
as intentionally (regulary) ended, thus the line break at the end of such line
should remain untouched.

5, If the whole line is based on different font than the majority of the
'intended consistent' block, the probability of line mis-break is smaller; the
line could also represent kinda header.


Please, add more rules if You wish.

In general, the function would analyse the text block, or whole document if
selected, and remove the line breaks that are suspected of being 'unintentional'
or 'mis-used'.","ENHANCEMENT"
"Another option for Bad Document Correction Tool.
The option should detect and remove multiple spacebars in text.

1, If there are more than 2 spacebars together at the beginning of explicit line
(previous line was ended by line break), user probably misused spacebars to
create TAB-like start of the line. The multiple spacebars should be replaced
with single TAB.

2, If there are more than 2 spacebars together, they could mean, that user
misused the spacebar to do the line break (pressed spacebar many times to get to
the beginning of next line). They should be replaced with single line break.

3, If after previous steps remain some places with 2 spacebars together, they
probably can be safely replaced by single spacebar.","FEATURE"
"This is another option for the Bad Document Correction Tool (Issue 75524).
The purpose of the option is: detect and remove hardwired page numbering.

Sometimes the user dosen't know, how to put proper page numbering into document,
so he does it as on mechanical typewriter. He places some -1- or similar text on
the bottom of every page.

Since the pages are somewhat fuzzy, after intentional or printer-aided
reformatting, the 'page numbering' is corrupted. If the pages are 'shortened',
the 'page numbers' are moving up on every page. If page is 'prolonged', the
'page numbers' leak to the beginning of next page. Either way, they're bad.

The option should detect them somehow and remove completely, let the user make
his numbering, or offer call to the Page Numbering Wizzard (issue 7065).


The detection of 'hardwired page numbering' could be a difficult task if done
automatically, however much simpler if the user is asked to cooperate.

For example, the user could be asked to select the first sample of the
numbering. OOo could do some corrections of the sample (spacebars removal before
and after the pattern, line break removal etc). Even variations of the patterns
could be considered to allow flexibility and respect discrepancies and typos.
For example, if the user selected some '- 1 -' sample, then also variants '-
1-', '-1-', '-1 -' etc should be considered.

The help of the user would make the search much easier for the OpenOffice.org.
Not even the patterns could be detected more precisely than if they were totally
unknown. Also the distances between the 'hardwired page numbers' could be
guessed from the user selected sample.

OpenOffice.org should then search the patterns. All lines, that contain only a
number or somehow resembles the searched patterns, are suspected. OOo should
search similar pattern with number increased. Then it could do some statistical
analysis. Gauss-curve could be computated, representing, how often are such
patterns numbers repeating inside the document. If the curve is very sharp and
concentrated, meaning that such a pattern is repeated in quite predictible
intervals, then we have probably found the 'hardwired numbering' and such lines
could be safely removed.

Please note:
This option of Bad Document Correction Tool should take place BEFORE the Line
breaks correction (Issue 75549) and probably before any other options, because
the less corrections have been already taken to the document, the bigger chance
of precise results of 'hardwired page numbers' detection.","ENHANCEMENT"
"This is another option of the Bad Document Correction Tool (Issue 75524).
The purpose of the option is to remove excessive font variability.

Some users tend to use huge numbers of different font parameters. They seem to
assume, that the more fonts and font variants are used, the nicer and profi' the
document looks.

In fact, every-line-has-its-font documents are awful.

Yes, we can globally change the font. However, we could miss some formatting
behind too.

The OOo should scan the whole document and make statistical analysis, how many
letters are under each font variant. We consider any difference to be a new font
variant, for example italic/bold settings, font size etc.

Then, OOo would choose the 3 (or 4) most represented ('main') variants and
reformat the whole text to use just these. Every part of text, that is under
other font variant, should be applied the 'main' font variant that is somehow
closest to originally used one.","ENHANCEMENT"
"This is another option for the Bad Document Correction Tool (Issue 75524).
The purpose is to correct badly used interpunction symbols.

Some users don't respect or even know the ISO standardised convence for using
interpunction symbols, such as comma, dot, etc.. Any of these symbols should be
in normal text placed directly after word and followed by spacebar.

The OOo should search for usage of the interpunct symbols.

1, If there is a word beginning with interpunct symbol, then interpunct symbol
should be moved near to previous word (e.q. 'bad ,text' corrected to 'bad, text')

2, If there is number, followed with interpunct, spacebar and another number,
then it is probably a single number. The spacebar should be removed.
example: '1, 1000' corrected to '1,100'. However, if this is on beginning of
line (spacebars or TABs could be placed before too), then it could be a line
numbering followed by values, or table-like attemp. In that case, leave it
unchanged.

3, If there is interpunct inside a word, then several choices must be considered:

 a, If the first part of the word (before interpunct) is a number and second one
is not, then it is probably a numbering. Spacebar should be placed after the
interpunct, thus dividing the word into two words.
example: '1.text' corrected to '1. text'

 b, If the part of word after the interpunct is beginning with uppercase letter,
then they are probably two words, where second one is beginning of a new
sentence. Spacebar should be placed after the interpunct, thus dividing the word
into two words.
example: 'bad.Text' corrected to 'bad. Text'","ENHANCEMENT"

Some users keep their behaviour from the age of mechanical typewriters -they use

Since it dosen't look very good, we should get rid of the slashes.

If the OOo finds a word or several words, enclosed in slashes, and there are
spacebars before first and after the last slash, then the first slash should be
replaced by left bracket ( and the last slash by right bracket ).
example: '/slashed sentence/' replaced by '(slashed sentence)'

However, the space before and after is mandatory, because sometimes the slashes

3. Edit the header and the footer and add somehting to them (for ex. the words
'header' and 'footer')

The result will be something like this (| is the border and . is blank space):

...header...
|..........|
|..........|
|..........|
|..........|
...footer...

The borders will be limited by the header and footer. They wonÂ´t go from the top
to the bottom of the page (because the options 'header subjacent' and 'footer
subjacent' were unchecked).

3. Save this document normally as a .doc.

4. Now open the saved .doc in OpenOffice.org Word Processor (v. 2.1).

5. It will open just fine, except for the borders, that will go from the top to
the bottom, including around the header and footer, like this:

|..header..|
|..........|
|..........|
|..........|

* Why does it happen:

I think it happens because unlike MS word, Oo Writer does not have an option to
exclude the header and footer from the page borders. I think itÂ´s a
non-implemented feature, but I donÂ´t know the reason itÂ´s not there.

The funniest part is youÂ´re able to do the other way around. I mean, itÂ´s
possible to have borders just in headers and footers, but not around text body.


* Why IÂ´m reporting this feature:

The majority of the text documents people have here in my company were edited
and saved in MS word with page borders. Actually, itÂ´s the default template
here, which people use a lot. At top of the page, comes the company logo (with
no page borders). And at the botton of the page, comes the company address (with
no page borders). But the text body has page borders.

"I have a Czech version of OpenOffice 2.2 that I downloaded very recently from a
link from www.openoffice.cz. I have MS Windows 2000 Proffessional, Czech
version, running on a standard PC.

I imported a DXF file created in a schematics editting software into a OODraw.
The file was imported without problems and the graphics looks as it should. I
modified it a little and then I wanted to paste the resulting drawing to an
existing OOWrite document using a Copy - Paste method.

However, I could not paste the graphics. Instead of it, the OOWrite only jumped
to another page (about in the middle of a document) and no graphics appeared.

Interesting is, that when I paste the drawing into an empty OOWrite document, it
works. Also I found an interesting behavior: The longer the OOWrite document is,
the larger (higher) the boundary frame of the drawing is - I get a lot of extra
space above and to the left of the drawing. And finally, when the document
exceeds about 6 pages, the drawing will not paste anymore.

When I take any other drawing that I create directly in OODraw or import using
WMF file, the pasting works without problems. So this issue might be a result of
a fact that the file was imported from DXF.

I will try to add two attachments:

Lorem_Ipsum.odt - the text document
schematics.odg - the graphics

How to reproduce the error:

1. Open the Lorem_Ipsum in OOWrite and schematics in OODraw.
2. Select the entire drawing using a mouse, and right-click Copy
3. Place the cursor somewhere to the middle of the Lorem_Ipsum document, and
right-click Paste
4. The OOWrite will jump out of the cursor location, and you will not be able to
see the graphics.

Now shorten the Lorem_Ipsum to one page only, and repeat the process. You will
see that the graphics will paste, but its boundary will be about twice as high
as the height of the graphics itself.

And finally, make a new document and paste the graphics. It will paste without
problems.

I hope this helps you to resolve the problem.

"In OOo documentation, and in the following, 'direct formatting' means any
formatting which is not applied by the Style attached to a paragraph - for
example Bold applied by Ctrl+B.

Currently, in OOo 2.2.0 Writer, there are two commands to remove direct
formatting, so the selected text will only reflect the attached style:

- 'Default Formatting' removes both Character and Paragraph direct formatting.
- 'Remove Direct Character Formats' removes only direct Character formatting,
while keeping any direct Paragraph formatting.
(By the way: This command is broken in OOo 2.2.0 Writer. It is attached to
Ctrl+Shift+X but that has no effect. I have reported that bug in a separate Issue.)

I suggest we need a third command 'Remove Direct Paragraph Formats' which would
preserve any direct Character formatting and only remove any direct Paragraph
formatting.

Why it is needed:
Imagine the user has selected a block of several paragraphs, with various styles
such as a paragraph with Heading 1, two indented paras and some paras with the
Default style (body text).
Imagine the selection includes some words in Italics and some in Bold, all
applied directly.
It would be very useful to be able remove all direct paragraph formatting, to
fix inconsistent line spacing and indentation etc, without having to redo all
the detailed character formatting afterwards.

Personally, I prefer to always use styles instead of direct paragraph formatting
- but for character formatting of a few words in a paragraph I use direct
formatting, such as Ctrl+B and Ctrl+I.
I guess that is the same for many users of OOo Writer.

This strikes me as a problem for a couple of reasons.  If the format is

Also if you click on ANY part of the word ('ASIANSTEEV' in the example), and

"This is plea to fix this serious defect in OpenOffice.

I am not sure which version was the first to introduce it, but I have just
encountered it with a fresh copy of 2.2.

The problem: AutoCorrect has a setting 'Replace Custom Styles' that, when
activated, will replace all instances of custom styles with one of a selection
of default system styles.

Quote from the help text:

'Replace Custom Styles
Replaces the custom paragraph styles in the current document with the 'Default',
the 'Text Body', or the 'Text Body Indent' paragraph style.'

This would not be so bad if the setting were automatically 'off', but it is
automatically 'on' when OpenOffice is installed. I do not see the logic in this.
In fact, I consider it an extremely bad decision, since OpenOffice is designed
to make custom styles useful and simple and this default setting stands in its way.

Please make this default to 'off' in future.

on the subject, on oooforum:

Related bug reports here on openoffice.org are:

Issue #49175: which recommends a button to turn off all AutoCorrect defaults. I

this issue.

Issue #72339: this issue reports a further bug in AutoCorrect, where even after
switching options off, Tools|AutoFormat|Apply will still enforce some of them.

I'd jsut like to repeat that this is *not* a 'feature request' or 'enhancement'
report. One of the biggest 'features' of OpenOffice is its custom styles.
Effectively removing this with a default castrates OpenOffice and turns it into
a much worse contender for replacing Microsoft Word or other overblown word
processors.

"Please have a look on the attached files.

In the Writer document you see a table with several conditional text fields in
rows which are divided by 'next dataset' fields, so that the conditional
textfields of every row are assigned to a different dataset in the database.

The table has 10 rows for 10 datasets but the mailmerge only gets 7 datasets
from the database, so the conditional text fields in the lower 3 rows are not
being evaluated. 

In the rows I use these two conditions rotationally:
First:
IF
conditional_text_evaluation.abfrage_testtabelle.varchar_ignorecase NEQ ''
THEN
filled
ELSE

Second:
IF
conditional_text_evaluation.abfrage_testtabelle.varchar_ignorecase EQ ''
THEN

ELSE
filled

As you will see in the lower 3 rows of the resulting mailmerge document after
the execution of the mailmerge it always shows 'filled' though one of the
conditions has the 'filled' term as the THEN condition and the other has it as
ELSE condition.

I think that in case some of the conditional text fields don't retrieve a
dataset to evaluate from the database due an insufficient number of datasets,
always the ELSE condition should be used.","DEFECT"
"I am running 2.2.0 on Ubuntu Feisty. I have an issue with the UI behaviour of
the Writer application.

I wish to dock the Bullets & Numbering toolbar to the top-menu on a *permanent*
basis. I have docked the toolbar successfully, but when I move my cursor outside
of a bulleted list, the toolbar disappears from the screen. I have tried various
steps to make the toolbar 'sticky' (i.e. visible on a permanent basis) to no avail.


To reproduce:

1. Create a bulleted list using Writer (enter a few random points)

2. Place the cursor within the bulleted list. When the Bullets & Numbering
toolbar appears, dock it into the top nav bar by dragging it in. (Correct
behaviour, no problem here).

3. Move the cursor off the bulleted list. Observe that the toolbar disappears.
Again, correct behaviour for a 'context sensitive' toolbar that has not been
'made sticky' by the user.

NOW, with the cursor remaining OUTSIDE of the bulleted list (for example, on
some 'Default' text);

4. Select 'View > Toolbars' and click on 'Bullets & Numbering' to display the
toolbar. Observe that the toolbar is re-displayed in the former (docked)
position and that certain toolbar icons are grayed-out (inactive). (This is
correct behaviour.)

5. Now, move the cursor back into the bulleted list. Observe that the toolbar
remains in-place (correct behaviour) and that certain icons are now active, as
they should be.

6. Finally, now move the cursor OFF the bulleted list once again. Observe that
the toolbar now *disappears* once again, despite the fact that in Step 4 the
user attempted to make the toolbar 'sticky' even outside of a bulleted list. In
my view, this is behaviour is incorrect.

The only way to force the toolbar to be displayed outside of the bulleted list
(i.e. 'sticky') is to repeat step 4 once again. Grr.



I will leave it to the QA and developers but to me, this is a real usability
gripe. The user should have the ability to configure which toolbars remain
'sticky' on display at all times, and the remaining toolbars should appear on a
context-sensitive basis as per the default behaviour of the application.

All the best.

a failrly specific set of circumstances r.e. export to DOC 'word
97/2000/xp/2003' file containing a Table and certain line spacing combinations
  of the cells inside the table.

To Reproduce the problem:
* Create a new 'Text Document'
* Create a multi-column/row table and put multiple rows of text in each cell
  in order to be able to easily see the problem later-on.
* Select the entire table and change the Paragraph Format to have a Line-Spacing

* Select an individual Cell and set the line spacing to 'Single' via
  Format > Paragraph.
* Export the document as a WinWord 97/2000/XP/2003 (binary) DOC file.
* Import the document (or use an alterate viewer) and notice the 'Single'
  line-spacing has been lost!

After various experiments with winword-2000 and OpenOffice.org 2.2 on win32 I
  determined:-
* The problem is in Export, not Importer.
* Does not affect save/load OpenDocument files.
* Various other combinations of Line-Spacing in cells work, but putting
  'single' amongst lots of 'At Least' does NOT export correctly --
  e.g. Using Single inside table-full-of-Double and other combinations
  work fine, but this particular combination does not.
* Seems to affect running OpenOffice.org on multiple versions/platforms.

* A workaround is to set the line-spacing to 'At Least 1.0' instead of 'Single'

"The header or footer is _not_ in the margins as is discussed in the OO help.
 I believe that this used to work properly a while back but I'll have to fire up
5.2 to verify.  Anyhow, the help is incorrect and I'd prefer to have it
rectified as opposed to changing the help information.  It's preferable to be
able to install the header or footer _within_ the margins as opposed to have a
footer and then have to calculate what the required margin needs to be to work
with other pages that don't have a header or footer.

   This is how MS Word works and IMHO is the way that it should function. 
Imagine a document that wants 1' top margins for all pages so that the text
begins at 1' and then the author wants to put a header on some of the pages. 
This requires the author to create separate page styles for pages that have or
don't have the headers.
- if there is a header then the margin would be about 0.6' and then the header
would take up the remaining 0.4' requiring the author to figure this stuff out.
 The text would then follow the header.  If the author wants the header higher
up on the page then the margin needs to be less and the space taken up by the
header needs to increase - this requires too much time to fuss around with
details.  
- if there is no header then the margins are set to 1' and the text follows.

Preferably, the implementation would be as follows,
1)the author chooses the margin
2)the author chooses a (-)dimension to move the header _within_ the margin or an
offset from the page edge.

I've spent about 2 hrs researching this problem and it isn't in the various
documentation manuals, the forums, the help (which is incorrect), and it isn't

"Hi there

I think that there might be some possible improvements to the way that
bibliographic entries work in terms of keyboard usability.

Firstly, it's funny that the 'insert' thing for citations is Alt-I-X-B. To me it
is unintuitive that citations are listed under 'indexes and tables'. In my mind,
the act of inserting a citation is more related to inserting a cross-reference,
and should be in the top-level menu.

Secondly, when the bibliographic entry dialog comes up, there is no keyboard
focus in that dialog. For ease of use, the 'short name' dropdown should have the
focus, such that I can just type the first few characters of the reference name
then press enter.

It seems wrong that the 'short name' drop-down is position *below* the author
and title in this dialog, when in fact the author and title change only as a
result of changing the selected short name. They should be underneath.

I think that by default, the enter key should insert a reference *and* close the
dialog. Mostly one wishes to insert a single citation, so although this dialog
has the ability to insert multiple entries at once, this should not be the
default behaviour. Perhaps the buttons could say 'Insert', 'Insert + Close',
'Cancel', with the second one bound to the 'enter' key.

"I have been advised by a super user at the OOo forum to report this issue.

I have problems with masterfiles of which the subfiles are full of DDE linked
tables. When printing or exporting to PDF all tables are empty.
I use XP with OO 2.0.4 (it does not happen on another system with XP and OO
1.9.104, which I for this reason do not update).

I have posted about this issue on the OOo forum several times before without reply.

I have tried to export to OOtext_document .ODT but still all the subfiles are
linked. Printing this document with the OO 2.0.4 system results also in empty
tables.
However when I print this .ODT document with the OO 1.9.104 system, which does
not have access to all the subfiles, it prints fine. Of course I do not update
the links in this case.

I would like to attach some example/result files but have no clue how to do
that, please advice.

Side question (just ignore if this is the wrong place).
For me it could be a solution if I could make a 'hard copy' of the masterfile. I
mean that layout (headers, footers, etc.) does not change, but text/tables are
no longer linked to the subdocuments. In fact have a full copy of the masterfile
but no longer any linked text, so it is no masterfile anymore of course.
Since the document prints well on the 1.9.104 system, I guess all the text is
saved in the .ODT file correctly anyway, not directly depended to the subfiles.
So it would be great if I could have this file without all the link information
in it. Then I suppose it also would print fine on the OO 2.0.4 system.","DEFECT"

"There's an example (created out of a real-word usecase) that shows that unhiding
a text section that previously was hidden doesn't work reliable. With the help
of a short macro it is possible to produce a text section with the property
IsVisible=true, that is not visible in fact.

I've got a textdocument that contains some text sections where all but one text
sections should be invisible. The visible one represents a part of a text
written in a specific language and our letterhead system controls the
hiding/unhiding of the textsections depending on the language that is currently
set in a variable of our letterhead system. After some cycles of hiding and
unhiding the textsections, the problem occurs. The following macro simulate the
cycles of hiding and unhiding the text sections:

Sub showHideSections
  dim str as String
  str = ''
  sections = ThisComponent.getTextSections()
  for k=1 to 2
    for i=0 to sections.getCount()-1
      s = sections.getByIndex(i)
      s.IsVisible = true
      str = str & s.getName() & chr(10)
      s.IsVisible = false
    next i
  next k
  s.IsVisible = true
  msgbox str
End Sub

The macro iterates twice through all textsections in a document and switches
their visibility states from IsVisible=true to IsVisible=false. The last
textsection is set to be visible in the end, but the textsection is not shown in
fact where it's property IsVisible=true.

I will attach an example which could be used to reproduce the bug:

1) open the file showHideSectionsProblem.odt (YES to macros)
2) run the above macro (it's already included in the document as
Standard.Module1.showHideSections)
3) you can see that the second table gets hidden as the respective textsection
is hidden. But the last textsection called 'Berenglisch GROUPS ('england')'
should be visible in that place.
4) open the navigator (F5) and see that the textsection 'Berenglisch GROUPS
('england')' is grey'ed to mark a invisible textsection. 
5) in the navigator: call edit... on this textsection and see that the flag
'hidden' is not set for the textsection 'Berenglisch GROUPS ('england')'. So
this textsection should be visible.","DEFECT"

Change the serial number of the first label, the other labels should change 
serial number to match, incremented by 1 each label.
Notice that the first label in the middle column has the same serial number as 
the first label in the first column (startsernum) even though it is set to [

field with standard text, the first label in the right column then calculates 
incorrectly.

You can muck around with replacing the fields, and all looks fine until you 
try to print, then OOo recalculates the fields, and prints the defective value 
(that's when I start banging my head on the desk :-)  ).

each numbering level. For example, if I am writing a thesis, the main chapters
are to be numbered 1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, 2.1 and so forth (using heading level 1 and
outline level 1) and the the appendix section should be numbered A, A.1, A.2, B,
B.1 and so forth. This is a limitation in writer that prevents it from being
useful for writing books or theses.

Searching extensively for a solution with google there are a number of
workarounds. One was attempting custom numbering styles and heading styles, the
other customizing a higher outline level to cater for appendix numbers and
headings. Unfortunately they all disrupt the auto generation of contents and
caption numbering breaks.For example, auto-caption that depends on sub-levels of
numbering will not work as hoped for. I've made a sample document to illustrate
the difficulties with the various workarounds I attempted. (I will attempt to
attach it.)

I realize adding different numbering styles for each numbering level may well be
highly complex. One of two suggestions I have is to be able to specify the
outline numbering per section, such that one can create a chapter section, then
an appendix section, and set the outline number for each type of section. The
second suggestion: just like one can specify numbering should restart, how about
having an option that a different numbering style should be applied from that
point forward. Of course, there may be better solutions than these.

surprised to find none (but maybe I just missed it - hope this is not a duplicate).","ENHANCEMENT"

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

Mit freundlichen GrÃ¼ÃŸen
II.Abdruck von I.
Polizeiinspektion
III.WV
Im Auftrag



Max Mux
--

Please Note:
- the line 'II. Abdruck von I.' is formatted with an paragraph format, that
defines some spacing befor the paragraph.

- the line 'Im Auftrag' is formatted with a paragraph format, that does NOT
define any spacings before the paragraph.

My Macro 'missingUpdateWhenHidingBug' simply creates a textcursor, places it
over the content 'II. Abdruck von I.
Polizeiinspektion
III.WV' and hides the content.

After hiding the three lines, I would expect the line 'Im Auftrag' to be
displayed directly below the line 'Mit freundlichen GrÃ¼ÃŸen' without any spacing
between the two paragraphs. But as you can see when you call the macro for the
first time, there IS a spacing between the two paragraphs.

Here is the macrocode 'missingUpdateWhenHidingBug' (it's also included in the
attached document):

Sub missingUpdateWhenHidingBug
    t = ThisComponent.Text
    cursor = t.createTextCursorByRange(t.Start)

    cursor.gotoNextParagraph(false) ' place the cursor over the
    cursor.gotoNextParagraph(false) ' text: 'II. Abdruck von I.
    cursor.gotoNextParagraph(false) '        Polizeiinspektion
    cursor.gotoNextParagraph(false) '        III. WV'
    cursor.gotoNextParagraph(false)
    cursor.gotoNextParagraph(true)
    cursor.gotoNextParagraph(true)
    cursor.gotoEndOfParagraph(true)

    cursor.CharHidden = true  'And hide the text

'   cursor.CharHidden = false 'uncommenting these two lines is a workaround!
'   cursor.CharHidden = true
End Sub

Here is how to reproduce:
1) Open the attached document missingUpdateWhenHidingBug
2) Call the included macro Standard.Module1.missingUpdateWhenHidingBug
3) now you can see, that there is some spacing between 'Mit freundlichen GrÃ¼ÃŸen'
and 'Im Auftrag' which should not be.
4) If you unhide the part of the text (for example via the UI) and call the
macro again, everything seems to be OK.

As I noticed the behaviour described in 4), I got the idea for a workaround:
just set Hidden=true, Hidden=false and Hidden=true again, and everything seems
to be fine. To activate the workaround, simply uncomment the last two lines of
the macro.","DEFECT"

"on a fresh ubuntu 7.04 installation, i installed a type1 font, Adobe's ITC Stone
Serif. the font showed up in OOo Writer's font pull-down menu, but it was
rendered using a completely unrelated, sans-serif font (i hadn't specified any
font substitutions). any text that i formatted as Stone Serif came out looking
like it was set in the 'Saab' font.

on examination of the font files, i found:

FontName StoneSerif
FullName ITC Stone Serif
FamilyName ITC Stone Serif

what shows up in OOo Writer's font pulldown menu is 'Stone Serif' (with a
space), which is not identical to any of the above strings.

i installed the fontforge package and used it to remove the 'ITC' from the
FamilyName field, installed the modified font, and this cured the problem.

i tried a few fonts, and observed that the problem occurs with fonts whose name
starts with ITC, and doesn't occur with fonts that don't have ITC in their
names. i only tried a few so i can't say for sure exactly what it is about the
name that causes the problem, but i know at least that changing 'ITC Stone
Serif' to 'Stone Serif' fixes the problem.

since the ITC Stone Serif is not freely distributable, i have made a couple of
test fonts, derived from the Century Schoolbook L font that comes with ubuntu.
they are identical to Century Schoolbook L, except that the name has been
changed to BlahDeBlah, and the UID is the randomly-generated value, 4150396.

i am attaching several files:

    original.afm, original.pfb - font named 'ITC BlahDeBlah'
    workaround.afm, workaround.pfb - font named 'BlahDeBlah'
    blah.odt - small example text file containing 3 lines of text

i'm not sure how widespread this problem is, but i know that, at least, it is
reproducible on a fresh installation of ubuntu 7.04.

to reproduce the problem:

(1) copy original.afm and original.pfb to your ~/.fonts directory.

(2) open blah.odt in OOo Writer. the middle line, formatted in the BlahDeBlah
font, should look identical to the top line, formatted in Century Schoolbook L,
but it doesn't. instead, it looks like the bottom line, which is formatted in
the Saab font. notice that BlahDeBlah shows up in the pulldown font menu, but it
is also rendered wrong there.

(3) close OOo Writer.

(4) remove original.afm and original.pfb from ~/.fonts

(5) copy workaround.afm and workaround.pfb to ~/.fonts

(6) open blah.odt again in OOo Writer. now the middle line looks like the top
line, as it should, and BlahDeBlah in the font pulldown menu looks right.

this is exactly analogous to the process i went thru with ITC Stone Serif.

although i haven't tried many fonts, i expect this problem to be pretty
widespread among people who depend on professional-level fonts. for an expert,
it's a troublesome problem, and for a new linux user who depended on these
fonts, it would be a complete showstopper.","DEFECT"

(b) New (text only)
When inserting autotext into a document, the results differ with respect to a

(a) no final line break
(b) final line break (end of paragraph break).

I suggest to change the behaviour of (b), i.e. to suppress the final line break
when reading the autotext into the document.

Advantages:
(1) same behaviour for (a) and (b)
(2) especially for short type (b) autotexts 'snippets' it is much more
convenient to continue typing without interruption to delete the final line break 
(3) a series of type (b) autotexts can be inserted without deleting the unwanted
line breaks in between
(4) the present labels (a) and (b) for the creation of new autotexts, which do
not reflect the above mentioned difference could remain as they are (otherwise
the labels should be modified!)

Backward compatibility:
It is only a very little efford to get used to inserting a paragraph break by
hand for somebody who is used to the present behaviour of (b).

By changing just the reading of autotext type (b), there is no need to change
anything inside existing autotext files, where both types of autotext are stored

"I can always tell the difference between a professional publishing application
and MS Word. Unfortunately, this applies to OOo Writer, too.

I will start therefore to file issues that describe these advanced features,
features that make the difference between an advanced publishing application and
the ordinary office bundles.

= *Fixed Lower Text/Object Boundary* =

The lower margin of all document pages shall be kept constant. Any objects (like
text, images, tables, ...) that delimit the lower margin of the page shall
extend up to this Common Lower Boundary. This gives a professional touch to the
document. [The last page in the document shall be exempted from this constraint.]

This feature can be applied to:
 - enable the same lower boundary for *every page* in the document
 - enable the same lower boundary for a *multi-column* page !!!

*Lower Boundary:* refers to the baseline of the object / last text line at the
bottom of the page.

= Competing Product Analysis =

MS Word XP does NOT have this feature. Unfortunately, this is a very poor
comparator when it comes to high end publishing software. [I do NOT have access
to newer MS products.]

High End Publishing Software:
I am aware of this feature since at least 1997. This is now 10 years old. Many
high ranking journals publish articles formatted in this way: see e.g.
http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/CID/journal/issues/v24n6/ju04_1048/ju04_1048.web.pdf
published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in 1997 (such old content can be
accessed freely without a registration). For the full list of available journal
issues, see http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/CID/journal/available.html (1 year
old issues are usually free). Nature (http://www.nature.com) is another journal
that publishes articles formatted this way (unfortunately no free access).
Actually, I know a dozen of high ranking journals that use for a number of years
now this publishing feature.

= *EXAMPLES* =

I will attach some images from an article published in 1997 in CID depicting
this behaviour. I believe that these images do NOT violate any copyrights (they
cover only small parts of the article) and represent fair use. See attached
jpg-images depicting the lower boundary for some 2-column page examples:
text-vs-text, text-vs-image text and small text-vs-small text (bibliography).

= *IMPLEMENTATION* =

Currently, the ODF-file format does NOT allow to save such information.
Therefore, in a first step it is necessary to modify and extend the
ODF-specification. I recommend doing this in the OOo 3.0 time-frame.

This feature should be then implemented proper in a second step, somewhere in
the OOo 3.x time-frame. However, some preparatory work should be done prior to
OOo 3.0, too.

== *IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS* ==
The line spacing and spacing between various word-objects (images, tables,
paragraphs) should be increased automatically, so that the last line on the page
/ in each column will have a pre-specified base-line.

See attached exapmles. A similar discussion took already place on the OASIS
mailing list (2-4? months ago), though I don't know IF there was any progress on
this.","ENHANCEMENT"

"I have created a sample Word Perfect document using Word Perfect version 8.  I wish to first commend your team on the amazing improvement in import from prior versions.  Page headers appear okay, even where they change from every page to A and B used for even and odd pages.  Page and chapter numbers insert correctly.

There are two problems with table of contents.  Formatting is lost on import and cross-references do not remain hyperlinks.  This applies to all cross references, not just to those in the table of contents.  They remain color blue, but they become static text.  

The Table of Contents is supposed to be dotted before each page number (dotted lead-in) this is lost on conversion.  Each page is a hyperlink to that page.  Also when a cross-reference page hyperlink is used on a page it also gets changed to a flat page number text; the hyperlink is lost.

I have attached a Word Perfect document as a mockup and a PDF done with PDFForge, the open source Windows PDF printer driver.  

Part of the reason I want to switch from Word Perfect 8 to OOO is so that when I generate a document as a PDF, the page numbers in the table of contents should end up as hyperlinks to that page so when someone views the document as a PDF they can click on a page number and go to that page.  While PDFForge is nice, when Word Perfect prints out the document to a PDF driver the internal hyperlinks are lost.

I'd also like to be able to go to a freely open source application.

"Connects to but is not the same as Bug 117112.  When importing a document from Word Perfect Version 8, the headers 'crawl' and some terminate early, marking a particular page with a header that belongs to a different page which might normally be later in the document.

Also the format of the headers is lost.  In a previous version I tried loading my document which was a Word Perfect 8 document.  As it turned out, your program was basically 'bug compatible' with Microsoft Word 97; you both misformatted it the same way, you inserted a line into the header below the text which wasn't originally there.

What would otherwise have been a serious bug turned out to be an improvement; I liked it better the way you 'mangled' it so I inserted a horizontal line into the header in Word Perfect.  

Importing the Word Perfect document back into OOO loses the horizontal line which is now there!  It will take me a bit to create a sample as my document is some 750 pages and I don't particularly want to upload all of it.

"I believe this is different from Bug #17860, which deals with external drawing objects.

The document in question is described below (see arrow bullets). It has multiple drawing objects (boxes drawn within OOo).

Problem experienced today in OOo 3.2.1:

I have been able to select multiple ones in order to change the line settings, but after a while I'd be unable to select multiple drawing objects. As a workaround, when I re-enabled the drawing toolbar I was able to select multiple objects again.

Problem experienced today in OOo 3.3:

Just before submitting this bug, I installed OOo 3.3 to confirm the bug hasn't been fixed. It is now worse. Now when I click on one of the drawing objects in one cell and shift-click on one in the next cell over, the focus moves to the image in the first cell (i.e. that image is selected) and neither of the drawing objects is selected. Toggling the drawing toolbar does nothing.

Description of document:

-> The document contains many pages of 4x4 tables which extend to the edges of the page. Each cell (352 in total) contains a small image, a number, and a rectangular drawing object for a border (line only, no fill). It was created about 3 years ago with the OOo version of the day, and I've updated it annually to change the borders around the cells. I make sure to click on the line to select the objects.

-> The image and border are the same for each cell, though they're copy-pasted. Due to the length of the document and because each of the 352 cells contains an image, the document takes a long time to load, save, and even to scroll up/down, zoom, and navigate. The file itself is only 201kb.

-> What I am trying to do is shift-select the border objects only to select all 16 of the 'border' drawing objects on a page in order to change their line type all at once. I have done this before for previous versions of this document, and I have done so with OOo3.2.1 earlier today, but at a certain time it just stopped.

A complicating factor is the toolbars that appear and disappear based on what is selected. This causes the view to shift up/down, making it harder to aim for the objects.","DEFECT"

2) Mail Merge via File->Print->YES (print into file)

3) Mail Merge via API-Service css.text.MailMerge 

The result is, that all three mechanism seems to be implemented different and have different timings/performance.

Winner was Mail Merge Wizard, Second the API-Service and last File->Print. File->Print is over 20% slower than the Mail Merge Wizard. See attached pdf-document with the measured timings and a small diagram.

From other experiences I got with the OOo-Mail Merge I also know, that File->Print uses a temporary file in /tmp/<dir>/sv.*tmp where as the Mail Merge Wizard uses a newly created empty document (in memory) instead for each processed database entry. So the mechanism diverge not just in timing, but also in the implementation details. 

The enhancement should be to consolidate the three mechanism into one mechanism with the same algorithm and performance. The new mechanism should be aligned to the faster mechanism of the Mail Merge Wizard. The mechanisms 2) and 3) will be accelerated by that enormously.

performance-test of mail merge jobs in OOo

Regarding to my performance-Tests for issue #118222 (the corresponding diagram is also attached to this issue) it is obvious to see that mail merge into one file in OOo has a non linear timing behaviour regarding the number of processed database elements (n). It seems that the OOo mail merge has a complexity of O(n²).

Due to this behaviour the mail merge of large jobs into one file is in much scenarious not practical. On my host the merge with over 500 datasets needs more than acceptable time. We have got real scenarios where people need to perform mail merge jobs with over 4000 datasets.

The improvement should be to get a nearly linear timing behaviour by optimizing the current mail merge algorithms and underlying data structures.","ENHANCEMENT"

Scree Shots of the issue

Hi OOO Office Team,

I have been using the ooo office suite over many years on Windows and Linux platforms at home and I have become really fan of it! So please move on with it! 

Since two years, I have been using it also on my MacBook. There, I always encounter an issue while editing flowing texts, especially inside table cells which I never saw on my Windows PC.

Editing flow text inside tables is really horrible since the cursor is not in the correct position in between two letters. In most cases it is right on a letter and you really do not know where you will insert, replace or delete letters.

If you however change properties of this text part, cursor is again in the right place as it should be. So I think, it should be somehow possible to get this issue fixed. 

I took some screen shots and attached them to this report.

I hope you get this solved. This would make my writing much more easier!

Thanks in advance,

Regards,

File exhibiting the defect/issue

I have some documents with large amounts of text in tables. These have been edited and saved using OO Writer previously in .doc format. On opening some of these documents later, using OO 3.3 Writer, I find that some of the text in the tables is not visible. When I then open the same file in Microsoft Word 2007, the text IS VISIBLE - it appears as it should. When I then reopen the file in OO 3.3 Writer, text that was visible in MS Word is once again INVISIBLE. I have attached a sample file. Note that every cell in the first column shows text when opened with MS Word.

I note the following in relation to this issue:
- editing and resaving the document in Writer or Word has no effect, even where the table size and amount of text is greatly reduced.
- only cells in the first column have been observed having this issue.
- the issue is not consistent across the whole column
- for affected cells, the cursor moves from the last character of previous row, not to the first character of the next row, but somewhere slightly to the left. If a selection is made, starting from this point, and then copied, the invisible text can be captured and then pasted elsewhere.
- When I save the document in ODT format (using Writer), the issue remains in the new file.

example with large table and several columns

I have a large table with many rows and this table is in a section with four columns, so that it needs to get distributed over the columns and several pages. Sometimes it is ok and sometimes not. In some cases there are even several empty pages in between, sometimes the last page is not optimal filled, and sometimes there are empty columns in between.

Test File to see Bug

When opening the attached Demo-File with MS-Word you see 2 footnates (correct).
When opening the same file with Openoffice, no Footnotes are there (wrong).
Openoffice removes both footnotes when opening this MS-Word(.doc)-File.

The removed Footnote 2 (of the attached demo-File) is inside the main-text (where openoffice supports footnotes).
There is no valid reason, why Footnote 2 is removed by openoffice.

Footnote 1 is in a Textframe (where openoffice does not support footnotes).
I understand that this is a problem. But just deleting the footnote doesn't seem to be the right solution for this problem!
The MS-converter solves this by moving the frame-content into the main-text.
An other solution would be to move the footnote-content inside the textframe.

As already mentioned, Footnote 2 is not in a Textframe, its at a valid position! And still this one is removed too.

Sidenote: The fact that openoffice does not support footnotes in text-frame should be considered as bug too (in my oppinion). Microsoft's office can do it! Why can't oppenoffice do it?","DEFECT"

Sample Writer document with inserted table - play around with it!

If numbers in a table inserted in a Writer document are the results of a calculation - for example, a simple multiplication of a quantity column and a cost column - the result column format is incorrect. While numbers can be right-clicked and the 'Number format' chosen, a decimal tab in that column's ruler has no effect and different length numbers are not correctly aligned to the (different) decimal point symbol for the chosen langauge.

In my specific case I'm writing an invoice or a purchase order in US dollars on a system that is set up for German by default. Any alteration to the figures throws out the chosen US format with a comma thousands separator and decimal point and reverts to German with a dot thousands separator and decimal comma. This gives a diabolically incorrect mathematical result.

Changing the format after figures have already been entered in cells even changes the figures to zero!","DEFECT"

"If a multi-line block of text has its width scaled above 100%, sometimes the last line of text in a paragraph will fail to wrap correctly and extend beyond the right page boundary.

Steps to replicate:
1. Create a new document in Writer.

Quisque fringilla pretium magna, quis aliquam felis vehicula ut. Nunc nec diam ac magna vehicula tristique iaculis sed augue.

3. Highlight the pasted text, and scale its width to 999% (Format-Character-Position-Scale width).
4. Observe how the last line of text extends past the right page boundary.

This is a longtime bug with floating toolbars in OO that need fixing before 3.4 release. Currently when you enter a table in writer the table toolbar appears on the screen. This behavior should be user configurable to prevent automatic display of all floating toolbars. It is horribly distracting to need to get to information that is covered up by floating toolbars.

Further, after closing the floating table toolbar if you move out of the table and then back in, the toolbar pops back up. This should not happen if the toolbar has been previously closed. If a floating toolbar is displayed and closed by the user, then it should not reappear on reentry into whatever caused it to appear (i.e. a table or whatever context caused the dialog to appear).

The logic for this should be simple:

(1) if floating toolbars are going to be displayed based on context, then a configuration option must exist that allows the user to disable this behavior globally. The pop-up toolbars are really annoying. The auto display of floating toolbars should also be configurable on a per-toolbar basis. The user may want the table toolbar to auto display, but not the drawing or fontwork toolbars.

(2) if the auto-display floating toolbar option is enabled by the user, then dismissing a toolbar should prevent redisplay of the toolbar for all of the same contexts within the document. Meaning if it is set to auto-display and the user kills it, then oo should be smart enough to disable any further auto-display of that toolbar for the remainder of that editing session.

"If you have a ms-word document (or oo-writer document) with special text-colors, which do not exist in your openoffice-configuration, then this special color is listed in the format-character - dialogue as 'userdefined' (or similar, in german it is called 'Benutzer').

Guys,

  Great job with 3.4! There is no such thing as bug-free code, but for an initial AOO release - this looks pretty clean. Here is a bug that is just frustrating. When pasting into a writer document (either plain text or text from another writer doc) the cursor is moved back to the start of the insertion after the paste is done. Meaning - after you paste some text, the cursor moves back to the beginning of what you just pasted and you have to either arrow, or use end, to get back to the end of what you just pasted to be able to continue typing in the document.

Example:

  If I have the following line with the cursor at the position shown by the carrot:

This is just a line where
                         ^

  and I want to paste ' I want to add some text'. After I paste the text, the cursor is moved back to the beginning of the paste leaving the current cursor in the middle of the sentence instead of the end. eg:

This is just a line where I want to add some text
                         ^

It's like somebody got confused and used 'memcpy' instead of 'mempcpy' when copying the new text into the current line.

I don't know what the actual issue is, but that is how it behaves.

Again - great job! Let me know if I can send anything else.","DEFECT"

Displaying page break more clearly and making them 'interactive'

Writer shows page breaks (PB) with a line on top of next page's text area. LyX shows manual PB with a line crossing the page on the insertion point with the text 'Page break' on the middle of it. These different approaches can be more or less useful, but both are conceptually wrong:

PB are not about breaking pages, PB are about breaking *text flow* and sending content to the next page.

So PB should be an attribute of the object (a paragraph, a table) that actually breaks content flow. But the problem is only on the way on which PB are *displayed* because 'on the background' Writer already work that way: on the paragraph format (both direct and style) or table properties we have a 'text flow' tab that allows us to define breaks, either before or after the object, either with or without page style change. 

Considering all this, I believe PB should be shown on the same object that creates the break, and on the object side where break occurs: this way, PB display will be consistent with how PB work on Writer. 

Changing the way on which PB are displayed gives also the opportunity to make them more 'interactive' by giving to the user simple and 'in place' tools to modify them.

"Using OpenOffice on Ubuntu.  I'm writing a manuscript, I have extensive notes that I (cleverly, I thought) made hidden text, so that I could view them quickly, but could still print up a note-less version to share with others.

Did this for several weeks, suddenly all the hidden text disappeared.  I click Show hidden paragraphs, Show non-printing characters.  Nada. Gone. Vanished. Vamoose.

Not some of it (it was interspersed among about 15 summaries), which it occurred to me I might have inadvertently deleted editing visible text (although I had checked that previously, it didn't seem that I could delete hidden text while it was hidden).  All of it.

It was pages and pages of notes.  Fortunately, I had an older version in the trash, didn't lose the work.

"Attention, I am using v3.3.0.

Hello, I have netbook screen and really need to use Fullscreen. I also need to use Find/Replace a lot. Find/Replace however does not work in Fullscreen. 
Please fix this! Thank you!

On a side note, in Calc, the bug that selecting several rows or columns with the keyboard leads to uncontrolled selection for up to a minute of hundreds of rows or columns seems still not completely fixed in 3.3.0 at least. It used to be worse in previous versions, but it is still there. If it has not been fixed in 3.4, you really will have to take a look at this again. 

On a third note, Open Office installs in a version specific folder, mentioning the version in its path. This is extremely bad for e.g. configured backup schemes etc. Could you please leave the path untouched in future updates, i.e. without a changing version number in it? Thanks for that, too.

Other than that, thanks for Open Office, I like it and recommend it a lot.

"Books often have chapters without titles: Chapter 21, or even just 21

If the numbering is generated by Tools > Outline Numbering, the headings will not be included in the ToC because the paragraph is empty. Adding a space, or any character at all, allows the heading to appear in the ToC.

Using paragraph numbering and setting the 'outline level' property leads to the same result: empty headings do not appear in the ToC.

Granted, printed books do not generally include a ToC, especially for chapters without titles, but a ToC may be desirable, for example, with on-line formats: a pdf or e-book, where the ToC provides links to jump to a particular chapter.

I don't see any advantage to automatically excluding empty headings; you can easily configure the index to exclude that outline level. Currently, the only way to include the empty headings, is to manually add some character to each heading paragraph.

It should be purely under the user's control which headings appear in the ToC.","ENHANCEMENT"

"I used OOo-dev 3.4.0, OOO340m0(Build:9583)on a Window 7 Operating system.  I also receive the save results using OOo 3.3.0.

When I go to Print and change the number of copies to 9999999999999999999..... and click print it appears it will accept this value.  The last '9' does not display completely and my OOo crashed when my print reached 2267 copies.  If I enter 99999999999999999...... and tab off of the field the 'number of copies' defaults to 16384 and the text box does is not sized correctly.

When I do this same task in MicroSoft Word 2010 I receive a message that 'The entry must be less than or equeal to 32767'.  In MicroSoft Word 2010 I am only able to enter 5 digits and the number must be less than or equal to 32767.  The text box never resizes in Word since I can't enter a number larger than the field allows.

Steps to create:
1.  Open blank document in Writer.
2.  Go to File > Print
3. Change the number of copies to 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
4. Click Print.

NOTE:  I was not hooked up to the printer I selected.

Actual Results:
It appears the value was accepted and OOo crashed after a length of time (I walked away and came back and the number of copies stopped at 2267).

Expected Result:
If 16384 is the max number of copies allowed for OOo Writer I expected a warning message if I attempted to enter a number larger.  If no message was received I expected the field to default back to the default value before the print was accepted and the box to resize back accordingly.

Other tests:
1.  When I entered 99999.... and tabbed off of the field it defaulted back to 16384, but the box was still sized incorrectly.

2.  When I toggled to another application and then toggled back the field it defaulted back to 16384, but the box was still sized incorrectly.

3.  When I mouse clicked to another application and then mouse clicked back the field it defaulted back to 16384, but the box was still sized incorrectly.

(see docx-warning.jpg included in attachment) If you choose 'NO', writer then says that the document could not be repaired and cannot be opened. (see docx-warning2.jpg) (you should also delete 'therefore' from the warning -- it is superfulous) The file PERINNIAL.doc is also included in the attachment.

However, instead of closing the file-open dialog and returning to the blank document, writer then immediately displays docx-warning.jpg again, followed by docx-warning2.jpg.

writer - Expected Behavior

example template showing the bug

Problem description: 
Due to this bug, it is possible to create a template which looks completely
different depending on which user interface language is set. This is highly
problematic as you have no guarantee that a template will look the same on all
office installations.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Change interface language to German and restart office.
2. Create a new document, add some text.
3. Add a new user defined style called 'Default'. Change its font to 'Verdana'.
Note that this don't change anything in your document as in german the default
style is called 'Standard'.
4. Save the document as .ott.
5. Change interface language to English and restart office.
6. Open the .ott file. Your document default style now has 'Verdana' set as
font.

Current behavior:
Predefined styles are named differently depending on user interface language.
Opening a template with a different user interface language set than it was
created opens the possibility that there are name conflicts between user
defined styles and predefined styles. This leads to different styles being used
depending on which language is set.

Expected behavior:
It should not be possible to define user defined styles which conflict with
predefined style names.

Example producing messed up mail merge outputs (on current LO/OOs only)

I hope somebody will read this long post. But obviously something mysterious happend to OO after v3.2.

I am preparing a rather complex mail letter with switching page forms (first page to standard) and backgrounds (vector drawings from Impress, linked via header), cr code and photo graphics, tables, one rotated text box and of course database fields, conditional output and so forth.
I'm familiar with these things and their problems, being an early DOS-Starwriter user (yes, even with paid licenses back in the days).

Surprisingly all of these features worked when I started a first run with a filled database, but the output was a complete mess though:
On some (not all) pages of the generated mail letters (4 pages each) footers were dropped (including page numbers), on the first letter (or data set) some (not all) graphics were gone, on the next letter they reappeared. From some page on tables were shrunk: their text contents -no variables- were gone. Boxes moved to the wrong page. Nearly everything was affected.
 
First I thought this had to do with the pdf export, but paper prints were messed up as well.

Then I removed 'suspicious' features one by one, but that also didn't help. The remaining elements were still corrupted, there was no 'critical' element to be isolated.

That led me to the idea that something more general could be buggy and I started to test other/former versions and this approach was successful:
Apache OpenOffice Portable 3.4: buggy output
LibreOffice Portable 3.5.5: buggy output
OpenOffice Portable 3.0: EVERYTHING PERFECT (okay, some impress issues, because of the newer graphic source, but nothing lost during the merge process)
OpenOffice Portable 3.2: EVERYTHING PERFECT (...)
All are portable versions (Apache is from winpenpack, the rest from portableapps) I could find, but from the results it's obvious that the problems don't have to do with portable or not.

The fact is that somewhere later than OO 3.2 the code (maybe of the mail merge component) must have been changed (in both forks) and seems to be pretty capricious now.

Attached there's an example file, which is stripped to the basics and linked to the default 'biblio' database, but it may be linked to any database.

If you print this as mail merge you will see all of the effects I mentioned above.
Remember - all these strange things won't happen in versions up to 3.2!
In my original file single prints are flawless. 

Interestingly (only) this example file will also show another strange effect in ALL versions: Sometimes, if you run single prints the last pages will be ROTATED (not shown in the preview). This effect is not reliable, but it happens from time to time, but in all tested versions.

Maybe this is a key (or predecessor) to the whole problem, so I leave it as it is.","DEFECT"

2- Again drag-n-drop several images all together on one movement, but being careful of using the last paragraph as 'drop target'

Result: as before, the images pile up on the same point, but if you select one of them and press the up arrow a couple of times, all the other images on the pile will be pushed below the selected image.

.docx and .doc problem files

In Apache Open Office 3.4.1 (AOO341m1 Build: 9593 Rev. 1372282) Final Russian UI/Locale on Russian Windows XP Professional SP3 (32bit)

If you open .docx file with AOO, you will see only 3 pages, and not shown correctly.
Tryed saving .docx into .doc with Office 2010 and then opening with AOO, but that didn't work.
Almost all letters in document replaced with X since this was contract.
If you open it with Office 2003 or Office 2010 you will see 114 pages of text.
Also, opening .doc file with AOO takes ages.
In LibO 3.6.1.2 is the same problem - there are only 3 pages shown, import of both files is very slow.

In MSOffice 2003 or MSOffice 2010 - all is fine, files opened quickly, wee see all 114 pages.

All 3 office suites count different quantity of words in documents:
In AOO 3.4.1 word count says that files contain:
.docx - 41990 words
.doc - 40826 words
In LibO 3.6.1.2 word count says that files contain:
.docx - 41786 words
.doc - 40497 words
In MSOffice 2003 word count says that files contain:
.docx - 41086 words
.doc - 41087 words
There is a suspicion that one or more office suites incorrectly count quantity of words in documents.","DEFECT"

"While working on a programming book using writer, I have lost hours of hours, because of the following behaviour of writer:

-> If paragraphs (copied via the clipboard from html writer where the programming code can be copied with its syntax colorized to writer) contain all characters formatted exactly the same way (e.g. text is in comment color, light grey), then changing in writer the paragraph style to a specific one (named 'code box', with background color etc.), then all such text gets mistakingly reset to the default formatting of the new paragraph style!

This has occurred for many instances (real big PITA!) as I processed more than 160 code examples, where comments, single word statetements and the like (all in their own paragraph) got reset. As a result, I had to go through all such copied parargraphs and see whether the syntax coloring has survived, and if not, manually re-colorize it!

As I plan to write another programming book, I would really appreciate it a lot, if this behaviour could be fixed such, that changing a paragraph style, does not automatically change the formatting, if characters got formatted individually (i.e. different from the default formatting of the source paragraph style). 

If the user desires to change the formatting of all the characters to the new paragraph style's default formatting, then this is easy enough: highlight the paragraph, right-mouse-click and pick 'Default formatting'.

[P.S.: Also when copying text from the 'html writer' via the clipboard into writer will force a manual page break, that switches to the HTML page style. This is totally unexpected and cumbersome as well, as I had to go through all 160+ code examples, place the cursor in the first line, get to the individual paragraph settings, text-flow, and remove the 'insert' manual page break there. Due to the incredible effort this turned into another PITA for this book project.]","DEFECT"

"Hello.
I repeatedly miss this feature (since years!) and want to suggest it:

All of my brochures/booklets are printed with a sheet of thicker paper (120g) for the outside cover and thinner paper (60-80g) for the inner pages.

Currently I have to manually sort the different kinds of paper and put them into one paper tray. This is extremely nasty, costs lots of time, and is therefore problematic when multiple booklets have to be printed.

I'd recommend adding a simple setup (i.e. in the booklet definition window), where I can simply choose one paper source/tray for the first/outside sheet and a different one for all succeeding pages. This is surely the easiest way and will match most requirements.","FEATURE"

I define a paragraph style named 'MyStyle 001', linked with 'Default', Indent Before text = 1,00 cm, Spacing Below paragraph = 0,20cm

Then I define a paragraph style named 'MyStyle 002', linked with 'MyStyle 001', Indent Before text = 2,00 cm, Spacing Below paragraph unchanged, which is still 0,20cm (inheriting from 'MyStyle001').

'Organiser', 'Contains' says 'Indent left 2,0cm, Indent right 0,0 cm'

I save the document and close it.

I reopen the document.

The paragraph style 'MyStyle001' has changed as follows:
The Spacing Below paragraph has been set to 0,0cm
In 'Organiser', 'Contains' it says 'Indent left 2,0cm, Indent right 0,0 cm + From top 0,0cm, From bottom 0,0cm'

If I leave 'Indent before text' unchanged when creating 'MyStyle002', Spacing below paragraph will not be set to 0,0cm.

Corrupted double angle quotes

Changing fonts in an RTF file sometimes corrupts characters, particularly angled double quotes, into some sort of Asian/dingbat glyph.

Reproducable on both Vista and XP with the following steps. corrupted file attached.

1. Created (or opened)testoocharacters.odt file with angled double quotes, using both Times and Trebuchet (one font per line), containing the text:

       “test”

       “Another test”

Saved as RTF

2. Added <“foo”> (without angle brackets) into the middle of string 'Another test' . 

3. Save/close/reopen, file looks fine. 

4. Changed <Another “foo” > to Arial. Save/close/reopen. Weird characters appear around “foo” in place of the double angle quotes. 

The reason this is a serious problem for me is that I use a writing program that works with RTF files. Before submitting my writing, I open the RTF in OpenOffice and add formatting, line spacing, etc. I then import the file back into the writing program, and now I have a file with a bunch of kanji characters in it (not just the angled double quotes, but a few other characters as well).","DEFECT"

"This bug was found in a OO v3.4 running in windows7 and Linux. It appears that
OpenOffice loses formatting when importing MS Office Open XML .docx files with
bullet or numbered lists. I have attached an example.

Steps to reproduce the bug:
1. Open attached BulletFormat.doc document in oowriter-3.4.1
2. Open attached BulletFormat.doc document in Word2007
3. Compare the documents. 

Notice the justified format code is lost in the bulleted text.


Oliver-Rainer Wittmann Fixed a similar bug with .doc files in the Bug 103711
The following was his analysis:
The analysis of Microsoft Word behavior reveals that the left indent for these
paragraphs are set at the paragraph itself, while the first line indent is set
at the corresponding list level of the applied list style.
When specifying the new position and space properties for list levels - see
specification http://specs.openoffice.org/writer/numbering/NewListLevelAttrs.odt
- such a situation has been overseen.
The problem that in OOo Writer all indent attributes (left indent, first line
indent and right indent) are combined in one attribute item makes it somehow
hard to take the left indent from the paragraph attributes and the first line
indent from the list level properties.

For the WW8 import I will implement the following solution:
- In case that a paragraph has only given a left indent and is inside a list
whose corresponding list level provides a first line indent the first line
indent from the list level is directly applied to the paragraph.","DEFECT"
"Inserting a picture mid document causes the following:

2. Writer assumes I want the picture in front of all of my text. I don't, I want the text to be wrapped top and bottom. Even when I change the wrapping to 'none' which seems to mean top and bottom it is still in front of all the text. I have to drag it around a few times and resize it to get it to top and bottom wrap.","DEFECT"
"If a direct formatting is applied on a part of a paragraph, then a new internal character style is created (T1 for example).
But if you apply a direct formatting to a whole paragraph, a new internal paragraph style is created and applied (P1 for example).
As a consequence, when you change the paragraph style with the styles drop-down list, P1 is lost, so your direct formatting is lost for that whole paragraph (but not for the string with direct formatting applied on a part of the paragraph).

Expected behavior: the whole paragraph should get an internal character style on top of the already applied paragraph style so that the direct formatting is preserved.

For further detail with content.xml analysis, see this post: http://forum.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=57972#p255941 and following posts.

Rationale: the direct formatting behavior should be consistent when applied to a part of a paragraph and a whole paragraph.

"The breakiterator used in Writer sometimes does not recognize correct linebreak or hyphenation opportunities. (With hyphenation activated, of course, and where Writer knows how to hyphenate a word.)

This has the following effect: Writer does not hyphenate a word although there is room enough on the line and although the automatic hyphenation algorithm can handle the word.

It happens very frequently when typographical quotation marks are present, but not in every case. Sometimes it is enough to add some character somewhere in the line with the word to make Writer hyphenate this word correctly.

I will attach sample documents. But it seems the line-breaking behaviour is at least often only reproducible with identical formatting environments: If you change the font or if Writer uses font substitution, the line breaks differently. And with other fonts, Writer may haphentate the word in question without any problems.

Document to reproduce defect (see Description)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open the attached document.

2. Add another carriage return at the beginning of the document.

Actual Results:

The paragraph to which the picture is anchored stays on the same page, whereas the picture *and the subsequent paragraphs* shift to the next page.

Expected Results:

Only the picture should have shifted to the next page. There is still room for some of the subsequent paragraphs above the bottom margin of the first page.

Bug occurs only when:

This bug occurs only when more than one paragraph wraps around a picture, as with a tall, narrow picture and/or short paragraphs such as a bullet list.

More about the picure settings:

This picture is anchored vertically to the top of a paragraph (specifically, the first paragraph below the heading) with 'Follow text flow' ticked. This last setting (which ought to be ticked by default!) ensures that the picture shifts to the next page if it doesn't fit above the bottom margin of the page (the area that the text flows in). 

Importance:

The ability to control a picture anchored vertically to a paragraph is a feature which distinguishes OpenOffice above MS Word, which has no setting or ability to keep a picture inside the margins when anchored vertically to a paragraph. But this feature of OpenOffice fails when more than one paragraph (the paragraph that the picture is anchored to) wraps around the picture.","DEFECT"

Test file: nested_tracked_changes.odt

When different users edit an ODT file with active change tracking, AOO is supposed to 'nest' revisions done by one user inside revisions done by another user when necessary: If User 1 adds text that User 2 later deletes, the insertion revision mark by User 1 is not simply removed but contained inside a deletion revision mark.

AOO saves such nested revisions correctly in DOC format, but fails in ODT files: Tracked deletions of tracked insertions are lost after reload of the document, and the deletion text portions are reordered.

Test system: AOO 3.4.1 (release) and a newer AOO snapshot (AOO350m1(Build:9611) - Rev. 1420743 / 2012-12-13_04:34:45 - Rev. 1421074), both Linux 64-bit-builds on Ubuntu 12.04/AMD64. Bug is also reproducible in LibreOffice.

Reproduce with the attached file:

(Keep 'Record changes' on. In the following reproduction steps, tracked changes text portions are marked with {}.)

Open file 'nested_tracked_changes.odt'. 'Record Changes' is active.
User 1 has added the word 'big':
  A mouse is running along the {big} motorway trying to find some cheese.
The 'Accept or Reject Changes' windows lists 1 tracked change:
  (1) User 1 insertion of 'big'

User 2 deletes 'running along the big motorway ':
The deletion is split into 3 different revision marks:
  (2) User 2 deletion of 'running along the '
  (3) User 2 deletion of the User 1 insertion '_big_'
  (4) User 2 deletion of ' motorway '
  A mouse is {running along the }{{big}}{ motorway }trying to find some cheese.
Revision (1) is correctly shown as nested inside revision (3) in the 'Accept or Reject Changes' window.

Save file as 'nested_tracked_changes.doc' (WW8) and as 'nested_tracked_changes.odt'. Close the file.

On opening the DOC version, all tracked changes correctly appear as before the file save.
On opening the ODT version, the file contents is corrupted:
- There are no nested changes: Revision (1) is lost.

When tabing through objects in writer one by one object is selected. But the sequence is top down in the view and not in the document. So when having 2 pages visible besides each other an object in the top area of the page shown on the right side is marked prior to an object in the bottom area of the page shown on the left side although the sequence within the document is just the other way around.

Scenario:

Apply a format to each frame in the document. That for, you might have a frame template you apply to each frame. This in our case will shorten the document as the frame requests more space in page margin area instead of pushing other document content aside. So you mark a first frame and apply the template to it. Then you press tab. Now a frame in the midst of a page shown on the left is marked while there is an other frame a tiny bit below on the next page which is shown on the right.

When you apply the template now, the document gets shorter so the just reformatted frame now is a little bit below the frame on the following page, so that one will be skipped when pressing tab to mark the next object.","DEFECT"

1 There are far too many useful functions which do not have graphic at all, so you end up with ‘Outline Numbering’ and ‘Word Count’ as icon! They all should have one in my view.

2 The intricate system of installing them is totally outmoded and very tedious. It needs to be streamlined.

3 Most important in this is that drag and drop should be the norm.

4 Also a better way of presenting all the icons for customisation needs to be found.

5 The standard set of icons is very limited and gives new users the impression that OOo is lacking in functionality and usability. A more comprehensive set would greatly help with this.

Document with 8.5' x 5.5' page size

I have odt documnents created in OO 3.2.1 that have a 'custom' page size of 8.5' x 5.5' - in the 'new' print (with mini preview) interface they always revert to A4 (or the last used standard page size). If I go into the printer (Cannon MG6250) properties and reinstate the custom size, it is 'forgotten' as soon as I try and print again.

My only solution after much head scratching and cursing is to reinstall 3.2.1 and everything then works as it should.

I am sure that this fault originated in the release of OO 3.3 with the much heralded 'New Easier to Use Print Interface' - so rather surprised it is still not fixed. Anyone that has to produce copy for specific but non 'standard' page sizes will have an insurmountable problem. For that reason I have tagged this as a 'major' bug.","DEFECT"

A short sample document

This problem is similar to another one I reported for 3.0 (Bug 94854), but not identical: there the problem was document-specific (disappeared after rebuilding the document on the newer version), was dependant on document length and was not easy to reproduce on new documents, characteristics not shared by this problem. 

To reproduce *this* problem, 

1- download the attachment
2- go to page 3: you'll see part of the text to the left of the page highlighted in yellow.
3- shrink Writer's window up to when the horizontal scroolbar becomes usable
4- click on the yellow text

Result: cursor jump to the heading instead of remaining where you clicked.

On page 7 the situation is even worst: cursor jumps to footer of previous page.

Tests:

1- with the problem triggered, zoom out reducing the work area until the scrollbar is not usable any more: problem disappears. Or
2- enlarge Writer's window until scrollbar is not usable any more: problem disappears.

This issue does not depends on the note inserted on page three: the note only increase the threshold to trigger the problem. 

The problem only affect cursor positioning with the mouse: moving the cursor with the keyboard does not show the problem.

Unfortunately, this list view is only 8 lines high.  This means that I have real trouble finding my desired heading from amongst the hundreds available to me.  This request is to allow the 'Fields' dialog (which contains the Selection) to be user resizable.  If I could make that dialog tall (say screen height) and the Selection list view sized its height to the size of the dialog, then I would have a much easier time finding the heading I want.","ENHANCEMENT"

.doc file

I have a document created with WORD - 'Sample.doc'
When I open it with WORD - all footnotes are shown, but when open the same document with Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1(without editing anything) - one of the footnote is missing. I've tested this on two Windows7 machines and one Windows XP - with the same result.

The original document was longer, and I've deleted all but problematic part - which is footnote after 'Candidate's category' (The whole document is in Bulgarian language, but I've translated just these words to easily reference them).

After playing with WORD 2010 options, I've discovered that if I click 'Candidate's category' text in the table, click RighMouseButton, click TableProperties, go to Table tab, in Text Wrapping section click 'None', click OK, and then SAVE the document - and after that open this document with Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1, the previously missing footnote is in its right place.

I've tried to find a way to make it appear without editing the original with WORD, but none of the options in OpenOffice did the job.

I hope you guys can fix this, because it is so annoying.

An MS Word .DOCX document containing only a small .BMP image.

Writer fails to render the image of a .DOCX MS Word file containing only a small, encoded bit mapped (.BMP) image.

This file was created by constructing a file, Images, using MS WordPad with small images of various formats to use as a base case file for fuzz testing OO Writer.  This file was saved in various formats including .ODT, .RTF, and .DOCX.

Writer rendered the .ODT and .RTF files consistently with MS Word and MS WordPad but failed to render anything from the .DOCX file.

This file was reduced until only a single image remained that failed to render, Images1.DOCX, attached.

A similar file was created, Images1.RTF, also attached, that Writer renders properly.

REPRODUCTION STEPS.

1. Save the attached files, Images1.RTF and Images1.DOCX in a convenient directory.
2. Open Images1.RTF with OO Writer, version 4.0.0, from the directory chosen in step 1.
3. Note the small image of an anser.
4. Open Images1.DOCX with MS Word 2007, from the directory chosen in step 1.
5. Note that the image is appears similar to that of step 3.
6. Close MS Word 2007 so that there will not be a file use conflict.
7. Open Images1.DOCX with OO Writer version 4.0.0.
8. Note that the image does not appear and that document page is empty and can be edited.  The document displayed should be the same as the document displayed in step 3.

"There seems to be no way to get spell check to work within a text form control. This is a CRITICAL problem, especially with multi-line text controls. The same spell check functions available in the Writer main body text should also be available in form text controls.

The form developer should be able to specify the default spell check configuration, set whether the user is allowed to temporarily or persistently override it, and use the state of spell check to make control and form decisions.

I can not stress enough just how badly this function is needed in OpenOffice and how much of a problem it is causing form developers. While Writer text may need spell check for the look and correctness of documents, form text generally goes into machine-searchable databases. Spelling errors in databases seriously cripples the search and sort process, and hampers cataloguing and cross-indexing. These are PRIMARY database functions seriously affected by this problem.

Personally, given that database functionality is integral to the OpenOffice suite, I think the severity of this problem should by Critical. However, a scan of other critical problems seems to reserve it for application crashing issues. Given the crippling effect this issue has on the use of a primary component of the suite, the database, it should, at the very least, have an overriding priority to other bell-and-whistle features in the next major release.","DEFECT"

That is, the pitch has been reduced to the width dimension.  The only work-around is to copy the label text and re-create a new label document on the label template using the text copied from the saved label sheet.  This works, but is tedious and the labels cannot be emailed to another user and print correctly.

The label feature is very useful, but I think it could be improved if editing tools were added so that you could change alignment, font size, bold, italic etc BEFORE creating the document with the text duplicated 30 times, so that each one has to be edited.","DEFECT"

navigator can't display umlauts in help topic

Steps to reproduce:
* open writer
* open help
* right click in navigator
* goto display

-> there is a menu point 'Help'
it's active and lets you navigate though the current help page elements


The main reason for reporting this is, it got a problem with german umlauts in help topics (see attachment).
Second, if you display the help file structure it doesn't show in the bottom drop down list.

I see several ways to make things better:
* fix the display issue
* don't show the help topics (like in the bottom document list)
* remove the display menu from the context menu (you still got the bottom list)
* remove the context menu (the navigator got icons / drop down bar for everything)

ps: there are no problems with umlauts in filenames and the help only shows in writer as far I could see.","DEFECT"
"While trying the procedure to reproduce bug 84905, I stumbled into a new bug:
pasting attachment 50595 from Paint to Writer produces an image with anti-aliasing; Paste as Paint Image gives a square image with anti-aliasing, whereas the original is rectangular; paste as GDI metafile and as bitmap give two seemingly different anti-aliased images, similar to the ctrl+v simple paste.
So, not at all what the average user would expect, I guess--I at least would like to see in Writer exactly what I started with, or at least have options through the 'Paste as...' menu.

Hope the details are enough.","DEFECT"

- insert an image in a document
- change it's anchoring to 'as character'
- write some text immediately below the image (in a new paragraph)
- resize the image, making it smaller

Behaviour: the text below remains in the same position, so that there is a big space between the image and the text now (bigger than the formatting specifies it)

Expectation: the text should move 'up', and be placed below the image, with the same spacing as before the resizing. The text is correctly placed in two cases:
    1/ when the document is closed and reopened
    2/ when a character is written immediately after the image (in the same paragraph)","DEFECT"

Save the document as MS 97/2000/XP DOC format to reproduce the problem

Consider following document with two pages (see attachment):
- first page has style 'First Page', second page has style 'Default'
- header on first page has few paragraphs, spacing '0.50 cm', not dynamic
- header on second page has many paragraphs, spacing '0.50 cm', not dynamic
- save in 'Microsoft 97/2000/XP' format

- header on first page is displayed with big spacing (bigger than the original file)
- header on second page is displayed correctly


After saving to DOC format, headers belonging to both 'First Page' and 'Default' page styles are transformed to dynamic spacing, with same spacing value. The expectation is that they should have different values, so that at least they are displayed exactly as before.

Conclusion: behaviour is normal in steps #b, #c and #g. The link to ACE behaves normally only when 'fresh'(#b).

This is misleading to the user who, after #d, might try the 'unvisited' links at C and E. The 'homogeneous' string BD behaves normally.
Same problem with other 'heterogeneous' strings: try 'GHI', where H is italicized.
I use strings like 'EmgCA12b5' as references, and underline some letters, such as C, to distinghish it visually from 'Emg' and 'A'.","DEFECT"

Deleting words from your custom wordbook corrupts your custom wordbook (file 'standard.dic' in user-folder 'wordbook').

Steps to reproduce:

1. Start with an empty wordbook -> empty user-folder 'wordbook' or a 'standard.dic' file that just contains the default entry:

OOoUserDict1
lang: <none>
type: positive
---

2. Open writer and type in the three words 'herxherx' 'hirxhirx' 'harxharx'

3. Add the three words to your custom wordbook (right-click on each and choose 'Add' -> 'standard.dic')

4. Now your 'standard.dic' file should look like this:

OOoUserDict1
lang: <none>
type: positive
---
harxharx
herxherx
hirxhirx

5.1 Go to 'Tools -> Options -> Language Settings -> Writing Aids -> User-defined dictionaries
-> 'standard [All]' -> Edit', delete the first entry (harxharx), then click 'close', then click 'OK' (closing the Options-Menu) then close Writer

5.1.1 Your wordbook entry now looks like this (last entry doubled):

OOoUserDict1
lang: <none>
type: positive
---
herxherx
hirxhirx
hirxhirx

Reset your wordbook, so it contains 'harxharx' 'herxherx' 'hirxhirx' again.

5.2 Go to 'Tools -> Options -> Language Settings -> Writing Aids -> User-defined dictionaries
-> 'standard [All]' -> Edit', delete the second entry (herxherx), then click 'close', then click 'OK' (closing the Options-Menu) then close Writer

5.2.1 Your wordbook entry now looks like this (last entry doubled):

OOoUserDict1
lang: <none>
type: positive
---
harxharx
hirxhirx
hirxhirx

Reset your wordbook, so it contains 'harxharx' 'herxherx' 'hirxhirx' again.

5.3 Go to 'Tools -> Options -> Language Settings -> Writing Aids -> User-defined dictionaries
-> 'standard [All]' -> Edit', delete the last entry (hirxhirx), then click 'close', then click 'OK' (closing the Options-Menu) then close Writer

5.3.1 Your wordbook entry now looks like this (nothing got deleted):

OOoUserDict1
lang: <none>
type: positive
---

Current behavior:

Expected behavior:

Deleting 'harxharx' should result in:

Deleting 'herxherx' should result in:

Simple text with bulleted paragraphs and a named style.

When a paragraphs is bulleted with an 'image' bullet, one cannot apply a named style having for example indents, especially, but not only, right indent.

See attached example.

Steps to reproduce:

- create a paragraph style with indenting, for example 5cm to the left, 5cm to the right. I called this style 'Paragraph with reduced width'.

- type a few paragraphs of text.

- add a bullet to some of the paragraph (menu Format / Bullets and numbering), and use one of those bullets from the 'Image' tab.

- try to apply the 'Paragraph with reduced width' style: 
    - on unbulleted paragraphs it works as expected, the paragraph will resize according to the indents
    - on bulleted paragraphs nothings happens, the indenting is not applied.

- when moving the paragraph's indent anchors (on the tabs bar) the indents are now applied to this paragraph. If I move for example the right indent anchor, it applies and the left indent (defined by the named style) also suddenly applies. If I double click the named style (from the styles popup window) it goes back to the unindented state, even if the styles defines indentation.","DEFECT"

Screenshots

The help search bar is very inconsistent with its search. (see attached document for screenshot of the help search bar I am talking about)
I discovered this bug on OpenOffice 4.0 -> AOO401m5(Build:9714)  -  Rev. 1524958 2013-09-20 11:40:29 (Fr, 20 Sep 2013)), using my Windows machine. The following steps explain the bug I encountered: 

These are the first set of steps I took to see how the search bar read my input:

1.Open up help menu in OO Writer
2.Type into the search bar ‘columns’
3.Click enter and observe the results

I received all results that contained the word ‘columns’. (see attached document) 

I then tried this test again but with a different search phrase:

1.Open up help menu in OO Writer
2.Type into the search bar ‘column’
3.Click enter and observe the results

I received no results for this search. This is odd because I know there is a document that has this word in it. (see attached document) 

When I do this test In OO 3.0 any document that had ‘column’ in it, or even ‘columns’ because column is in the word columns showed up.  I am comparing both versions and  both have almost identical help documents database.","DEFECT"

Picture of margin issue

This bug is an issue with being allowed to enter values into the margins settings from properties that cause issues and are handled differently in the Format>Page menu.


I am using AOO400m3(Build:9702)  -  Rev. 1503704 on a Windows 8 64bit machine.

To reproduce, create a new document in writer. 
Click Margin under properties on the right side of your screen by default.
Set for instance the Left margin to 5.00' and then set the Right margin to 5.00'.
If your using a default page size (8.5x11)you will see how this would be an issue. The left margin overlaps the right margin. 

Doing this from Format>Page will actually restrict the values upon hitting Ok to 5' and 3.3' so as to avoid overlap.
It seems like the code is there to properly handle this issue, just not implemented in the properties pane.

Another thing you can do is set the margins to 0' without any issue, which is fine. But you can also print using these settings, which is typically a problem. 

Printing from a Brother MFC-J430W printer with 0' margins, I lose about 2 characters on either side of the page.

MS Word for comparison will not let you exit the page setup window with invalid settings, and warns you if you exceed printer capabilities and selecting 'Fix' will assign a value of 0.11' to the margins. It also reports a problem if you try to set the value to something that causes an overlap of the margins and won't accept those values.","DEFECT"

graphic with top margin flush with page bottom margin

I am using Writer 4.0.1, AOO401m5(Build:9714)  -  Rev. 1524958

I found a bug when setting the bottom margin and dragging out a graphic. you can move the graphic outside any of the page margins. The behavior is different for the bottom margin then the other three. When dragging the graphic outside the top,left, and right margins I can move it anywhere outside the margin. With the bottom margin, when dragging the graphic outside it will set the graphic's top flush along the pages bottom margin. If I drag the graphic with the top margin inside the bottom margin but the rest of the graphic outside it will set itself where I let go. Also no new page is given to the user.  

I tested this in Microsoft word 2011 mac edition version 14.3.9 build number 131030 and it will not let you drag a graphic outside the page margins at all.If you go outside the margin it will not move the graphic at all. 


Steps taken to replicate:

1. I have resized the bottom margin to 5.79' and left the other margins at their default values of 0.79'. 
2. I have dragged out a graphic from the pane and set it inside the page margins.
3. Drag it outside the bottom page margin to the very end of the page. The graphic will align flush with the bottom margin. 
4. now drag it where the top of the graphic margin is inside the page margins and 
the rest of the graphic is outside then it will act as the top margin and set itself where I let go of it.","DEFECT"

Example of center function not working

After changing the before text indent value to something other than the default (for example 2cm), centering the text no longer works.

Steps to replicate.

1. Type random text that is less than a whole line's length.
2. Select the text and right click.
3. Open Paragraph window.
4. Change before text ident value to something like '2' and press ok.
5. Proceed to center text (Ctrl+E).

As you can see, the text will not be centered and instead be 2cm off on the right side.

I tried testing this with the after text indent value and it does the same thing, but in the opposite direction. This is also an issue with negative values like -1cm and on different types of papers and sizes (Letter, A4).

It seems like the centering function doesn't take into account the indentations of the lines and therefore ends up formatting the text incorrectly. I came to this conclusion since it is always consistent with distance that is lacking on the opposite side to make it centered.","DEFECT"
"While trying to apply a before text indent to a selected line(s) of text through the properties side menu (on the right of the window), and subsequently pressing enter to input the desired value, the selected text gets overwritten by the 'Enter' key and creates a new line in the document.

Steps to replicate.

1. Write some text in a new document and select it.
2. If properties side menu isn't already opened, open it (blue/green cube icon in top right).
3. Change the value of the before text indent and press enter.
4. Watch as cursor stays in the before text input box, but your selected text disappears.

For some reason 'Enter' causes this behaviour but other keys dont. Other inputs I have tried were letters, backspace, delete and other such keys. None of them do the same thing as enter.

The most confusing and upsetting part about this bug is the fact that the cursor stays in the input box, thus betraying the expectations of the user unexpectedly and (at first) inexplicably disappearing his/her content.","DEFECT"
"We are using OpenOffice Writer Documents and using 'Send->EMail as PDF' function.
With any 32bit mail applications like Thunderbird or Tobit we have no problems, but with Outlook 64 (64 Bit Version) we can't send any mails.

We always get 'Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request. Please run Microsoft Office Outlook and set 
it as the default mail client'.

But Outlook 64 is already default and the only client installed.

Microsoft describes this problem here:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dd941355.aspx

Looks like, OpenOffice is NOT using MAPISendMail, so this error occurs. 

Using Outlook 32 solves the problem... but I think this is a compatibility issue that should be fixed.

"Hello,
I would like to inform developers about a recurring error I experienced several times that caused the program to crash without getting back to working status (and made me lost all unsaved work every time I experienced this issue).

This specific issue recurs when doing the following steps:

1- Open any text file (I tested with .doc and .odt files only but I think this bug is not related to the format of file).

2- Manually select paragraphs/rows of text by holding LEFT-SHIFT and LEFT-CTRL and pressing DOWN ARROW key as many times as many paragraphs/rows you want to select.

3- When you get to the last row of document, if you keep holding LEFT-SHIFT and LEFT-CTRL and press RIGHT ARROW key, you cause the bug and the program crashes.

It doesn't matter how much text you manually select because it seems that only manually selecting last row causes the bug to happen.

I hope you fix it in the next update.

Follow steps in Sample document (to save time you can simply do step 13a in sample document in Table of step 12

10. Open attached Sample document
11. Create Table 7x7 and fill A1:B7 so that you can see results of edits easily
12. Merge Cells B3:D3 and F3:F5
13a. 'Click C5-> Click Delete Column Icon' (In Table Toolbar)
     Expected: Only Cells of Column C will be deleted
     Actual: All range B:D will be deleted               :-)
13b. For Comparison in Cell of step 12 'Click C5-> Click Delete Row Icon' 
     Expected: Only Cells of Row 5 will be deleted
     Actual: as expected

Additional information_
(a) We have Inconsistency between 'Delete Row', what has intuitive results,
    and  'Delete Column', what has unexpected results
(b) Do some more tests with other cells in same row or same column as 
    merged cells. You will see that the behavior in Writer differs from
    the behavior in Calc. There might be differences what can and should not be
    eliminated (also to keep similarity with other text processing programs?),
    but at least unnecessary differences should be eliminated

shows tables wrapping to wrong pages

This is a problem which has been bugging me for years with Open Office: it doesn't place my tables on the page properly.  It moves a table to the next page even when there is plenty of room.  

Open the attached 'Test.odt' and you will see the problem.  Table 2 would fit on page 1 but is placed at the top of page 2.  

Place the cursor just before the text 'Table 2' and hit Enter to add a line between tables 1 and 2 on page 1.  Hit Enter several more times and table 2 will pop back onto page 1.  Now you can backspace to eliminate the extra lines between the tables and table 1 will stay on page 1.  At random times or after closing and opening the file you will see the original problem reappear, however -- this doesn't fix it.","DEFECT"

Rev.1568575

Looking further at errant behavior in Writer table layout between actions of the horizontal ruler and the vertical ruler.

Mouse over movements of table row heights, with program focus in the text body rather than the table, are not being applied into the table. While similarly made column width settings are being applied.

To demonstrate:

With focus in the text body, the 'adjust table column' mouse over will activate the horizontal ruler and show the column settings (pair of vertical hashes on the ruler) for the table with mouse over pointer. A movement of the mouse over handle moves the column hashes on the horizontal ruler--and then updates the indicated table--the table never gains program focus.

The errant behavior occurs with focus again in the text body, the 'adjust table row' mouse over will activate the vertical ruler and display the row height settings (pair of horizontal hashes on the ruler) for the table with mouse over pointer. A movement of the handle moves the hashes on the vertical ruler--but then does NOT update the indicated table, also when released the vertical ruler retains the changed hash placement and is no longer correct for the rows as set for the table--again the table never gains program focus.

With focus moved into a cell of table object, both the 'adjust table column' and the 'adjust table row' mouse over actions again are reflected on the corresponding ruler, however the table is immediately updated by mouse over hash movements on either ruler.

This is issue 2 partially described in the bug 124210 'WRITER - Table (top row border) cannot be 'resized upwards'' enhancement request.

Have not tested this yet on OS X or Linux build, so could be an issue there as well.","DEFECT"
