However since _ XPropertySet ] 21: LOG Execute: getPropertySetInfo 21: Method getPropertySetInfo finished with state OKI would like to have the window minimizing automatically when it loses focus.Automatic window minimize does not work. Please fix it, I really hate it.I would like a new search feature that works on voice commands.
